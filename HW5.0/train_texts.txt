iably wins even if he be but slightly superior if the difference in skill could not be equalized in some way the game would become tiresome as the weaker player would almost always be able to foresee his defeat the stronger player therefore allows hi

	
s adversary to place enough stones on the board as a handicap to make the adversaries approximately equal  according to the rules of the academy if the difference between the skill of the players was only one degree the weaker player would be allowed

	
 the first move if the difference was two degrees the weaker player would be allowed to place a stone on the board and the stronger player would have the first move and so on in other words the difference between each degree might be called half a st

ce the fall of the shogunate forty years ago  this arrangement of the players in degrees is unknown in china and korea on the other hand it is in use in the ryukyu or loochoo islands  the japanese seem to have regarded the classification in degrees a

	
s an absolute standard of measurement nevertheless it must necessarily have varied from time to time and in the course of centuries the standard must gradually have risen  players of high rank who are challenged by the improving players of the lower 

	
grades will instinctively desire to make it more difficult for the new players to attain the higher degree because their own fame which is their highest possession depends upon the result of the game and assuming that all trial games could be conduct

	
ed in an impartial and judicial spirit nevertheless all the players would become more expert from the hard practice even if their skill in relation to each other remained the same  thus a seventh degree player of to-day would be better in a year alth

	
years ago as an illustration of this increase in skill we only have to compare the standard set in the ryukyu islands they also established the classification in degrees soon after the foundation of the academy in japan and then the two institutions 

	
seem to have lost touch korschelt relates that for the first time about the year   a go player of the second degree from the satsuma province visited those islands and tried his skill with their best players and found that he could easily defeat the 

	
players there classified as of the fifth degree  the position as head of the academy was much coveted by go players but it was generally held by the honinbo family one of the last incidents in relation to the academy tells of an attempt on the part o

lly defend his title however at last matters came to such a point that jowa ordered shuwa to present a petition to the shogun requesting that the title be settled by contest but the shogun s officer who was in league with inseki returned the petition

	
 whereupon all of the honinbo house rose and insisted on their rights in accordance with custom and precedent and at last their petition was granted it was fixed that the title was to be decided by ten games and the first game began at the residence 

	
of the shogun s officer inaba tango no kami on the  th of november in the eleventh year of tempo about sixty-six years ago  and it ended the same year on the  th of december there was an adjournment of four days and on one occasion the contest lasted

	
 all night therefore in all it took nine days and one night to finish the game  it is unnecessary to say that both players put forth all their efforts in this life and death struggle and it is said that inseki s excitement was so intense as to cause

the old national game was revived and at the present day it is fostered with as much zeal as in the olden times  most of the higher officials of the government and also the officers in the army and navy are skilled players the great daily newspapers 

	
of the capitals have a go department just as some of our periodicals have a department devoted to chess and the game is very much played at the hot springs and health resorts and clubs and teachers of the art are found in all of the larger cities go

 has been played we will proceed to a description of the board and stones and then take up the details of the play     ii description of the board and stones  the board or go ban as it is called in japanese is a solid block of wood about seventeen an

	
d a half inches long sixteen inches broad and generally about four or five inches thick it has four detachable feet or legs so that as it stands on the floor it is about eight inches high the board and feet are always stained yellow  the best boards 

	
ard as to be unpleasant to the touch when the stone is placed on the board and the wood must further have the quality of resonance because the japanese enjoy hearing the sound made by the stone as it is played and they always place it on the board wi

	
th considerable force when space will permit the japanese expression for playing go to wit  go wo utsu  literally means to strike go referring to the impact of the stone in korea this feature is carried to such an extreme that wires are stretched ben

	
eath the board so that as a stone is played a distinct musical sound is produced the best boards should of course be free from knots and the grain should run diagonally across them  in the back of the board there is cut a square depression the purpos

	
e of this is probably to make the block more resonant although the old japanese stories say that this depression was put there originally to receive the blood of the vanquished in case the excitement of the game led to a sanguinary conflict  the legs

	
nal rank of the lowest degree when we think that it would take twenty-seven years to play ten thousand games at the rate of one game per day we can get some idea of the japanese estimate of its difficulty the difficulty of the game and the remarkable

	
rain from making comments on the game a suggestion which all chess players will appreciate  on the board parallel with each edge are nineteen thin lacquered black lines these lines are about four one-hundredths of an inch wide it has been seen from t

	
he dimensions given that the board is not exactly square and the field therefore is a parallelogram the sides of which are sixteen and a half and fifteen inches long respectively and the lines in one direction are a little bit farther apart than in t

	
he other these lines by their crossing produce three hundred and sixty-one points of intersection including the corners and the points along the edge of the field  the stones are placed on these points of intersection and not in the spaces as the pie

	
ces are in chess or checkers these intersections are called me or moku in japanese which really means an eye  inasmuch as the word as used in this connection is untranslatable i shall hereafter refer to these points of intersection by their japanese

 so as the white a good set is quite dear and cannot be purchased under several yen the ideograph formerly used for go ishi indicates that originally they were made of wood and not of stone and the old chinese ideograph shows that in that country the

e a little bit wider than they should be in order to fit the board korschelt carefully measured the stones which he used and found that the black were seventeen-sixteenths of the distance between the vertical lines on his board and about eighteen-nin

	
eteenths of the distance between the horizontal lines while the white stones were thirteen-twelfths of the distance between the vertical lines and thirty-six thirty-sevenths of the distance between the horizontal lines i found about the same relation

	
 of size in the board and stones which i use  the result of this is that the stones do not have quite room enough and lap over each other and when the board is very full they push each other out of place to make matters still worse the japanese are n

 who live there have become familiar with it  on the other hand its intense interest is attested by the following saying of the japanese  go uchi wa oya no shini me ni mo awanu  which means that a man playing the game would not leave off even to be p

	
in their places  in japan the board is placed on the floor and the players sit on the floor also facing each other as shown in the illustration and generally the narrower side of the board is placed so as to face the players since the introduction of

	
 tables in japan go boards are also made thinner and without feet but the game seems to lose some of its charm when the customs of the old japan are departed from  the japanese always take the stone between the middle and index fingers and not betwee

	
n the thumb and index finger as we are likely to do and they place it on the board smartly and with great skill so that it gives a cheerful sound as before stated  for use in this country the board need not be so thick and need not of course have fee

	
t but if it is attempted to play the game on cardboard which has a dead sound as the stones are played it is surprising how much the pleasure of the game is diminished the author has found that casino chips are the best substitute for the japanese st

	
 present number of lines became fixed after trial and comparison with other possible sizes korschelt made certain experiments with the next possible larger size in which the number of lines in each direction was twenty-one and it seemed that the game

	
 could still be played although it made necessary the intellect of a past master to grasp the resulting combinations if more than twenty-one lines are used korschelt states that the combinations are beyond the reach of the human mind  in closing the 

	
description of the board it may be interesting to point out that the game which we call go bang or five in a row  is played on what is really a japanese go board and the word go bang is merely another phonetic imitation of the words by which the japa

	
nese designate their board i have found however that the go bang boards sold in the stores in this country are an imitation of the original japanese go ban  and have only seventeen lines and are therefore a little too small for the game as now played

iderable chance for analysis and the play often covers the entire board     iii rules of play  the players play alternately and the weaker player has the black stones and plays first unless a handicap has been given in which case the player using the

	
 white stones has the first move  in the olden times this was just reversed  they place the stones on the vacant points of intersection on the board or me  and they may place them wherever they please with the single exception of the case called ko  

	
which will be hereafter explained when the stones are once played they are never moved again  the object of the game of go is to secure territory just as the object of the game of chess is not to capture pieces but to checkmate the adverse king so in

the adjacent diagonal intersections cause a stone to be taken they do not directly attack the stone in the center at all plate  diagram iv shows this situation  a stone which is placed on the edge of the board may be surrounded and captured by three 

	
stones as shown in plate  diagram ii and if a stone is placed in the extreme corner of the board it may be surrounded and taken by two stones as shown in plate  diagram iii  in actual practice it seldom or never happens that a stone or group of stone

	
s is surrounded by the minimum number requisite under the rule for in that case the player whose stones were threatened could generally manage to break through his adversary s line it is almost always necessary to add helping stones to those that are

ite stone on that point in order to complete the capture of the stone in the corner  in order to capture a group or chain of stones containing vacant space it must be completely surrounded inside and out for instance the black group shown on plate  d

ith our chess and it may safely be said that go has nothing to fear from the comparison indeed it is not too much to say that it presents even greater opportunities for foresight and keen analysis  the japanese also play chess which they call shogi  

	
 before it is completely surrounded because when the situation is observed to be hopeless the losing player abandons it and addresses his energies to some other part of the board it is advantageous for the losing player to abandon such a group as soo

	
n as possible for if he continues to add to the group he loses not only the territory but the added stones also if the circumstances are such that his opponent has to reply to his moves in the hopeless territory the loss is not so great as the oppone

	
nt is meanwhile filling up spaces which would otherwise be vacant and against an inferior player there is a chance of the adversary making a slip and allowing the threatened stones to save themselves if however the situation is so clearly hopeless th

	
at the adversary is not replying move for move then every stone added to such a group means a loss of two points  at the end of the game such abandoned groups of stones are removed from the board just as if they had been completely surrounded and kil

	
be gained by either side in the process of actually surrounding such a group and its completion would only be a waste of time but let us suppose that a black group at the end of the game is found to be hopeless and also completely surrounded with the

	
 exception of one point the question arises can the black player demand that his adversary play on the vacant space in order to kill this group for if he could it is obvious he would gain one me by so doing the answer is he cannot so demand and his a

	
dversary is not bound to play on this point and the hopeless or abandoned stones are removed without further play we might call such groups dead  they may be distinguished from stones that are taken  because these latter are removed at once whereas d

	
ead stones are removed only at the end of the game  as a corollary to the rule for surrounding and taking stones it follows that a group of stones containing two disconnected vacant intersections or me cannot be taken this is not a separate rule it f

	
but it is slightly different from our chess and their game has not been so well developed  go on the other hand has been zealously played and scientifically developed for centuries and as will appear more at length in the chapter on the history of th

	
ram i there if a black stone is played at f   although it is played on an intersection entirely surrounded by white stones it nevertheless lives because the moment it is played it has the effect of killing the entire white group that is to say a ston

	
e may be played on an intersection where it is completely surrounded if as it is played it has the effect of completely surrounding the adversary s stones already on the board if on the other hand we have a situation as shown in plate  diagram ii a b

	
lack stone may indeed be played on one of the vacant intersections but when it is so played the white group is not completely surrounded because there still remains one space yet to be filled and the black stone itself is dead as soon as it touches t

	
he board and hence it would be impossible to surround this group of white stones unless two stones were played at once the white stones therefore can never be surrounded and form an impregnable position  this is the principle of the two me  and when 

	
 the corners of the board or how far from each other they may be  plate  diagram vi shows a group of stones containing two vacant me on the edge of the board this group is perfectly safe against attack a beginner might ask why the white group shown o

	
n plate  diagram v is not safe the difficulty with that group is that when black has played at s  there are no me in it at all as the word is used in this connection not even a kageme as shown in plate  diagram iii because a me  in order to be availa

	
ble for the purpose of defense must be a vacant intersection that is surrounded on four sides just as a captured stone must be surrounded and therefore on the sides of the board it can be made by three stones and in the corner of the board by two sto

	
nes but it is absolutely necessary in addition to the minimum number of surrounding stones to have helping stones to guard the surrounding stones against attack this brings us to what the japanese call kageme  in actual play there are many groups of 

	
e game it has during part of this time been recognized and fostered by the government until recently a systematic treatment of the game such as we are accustomed to in our books on chess has been lacking in japan a copious literature had been produce

	
e  plate  diagram iii is an illustration of this a beginner might think that the white group was safe but black can kill the upper six white stones by playing at e  and then on the next move can kill the remainder by playing at g  therefore e  is not

	
 a perfect me  but is kageme  g  is a perfect me  but one is not enough to save the group in this group if the stone at f  or d  were white there would be two perfect me  and the group would be safe in a close game beginners often find it difficult t

	
o distinguish between a perfect me and kageme  groups of stones which contain vacant spaces can be lost or saved according as two disconnected me can or cannot be formed in those spaces and the most interesting play in the game occurs along the sides

	
 and especially in the corners of the board in attempting to form or attempting to prevent the formation of these me  the attacking player often plays into the vacant space and sacrifices several stones with the ultimate object of reducing the space 

	
of defense is shown in plate  diagram iv where if it is white s turn and he plays in the corner of the board at t   he can save his stones if on the other hand he plays anywhere else the two me can never be formed the beginner would do well to work o

	
ut this situation for himself  the series of diagrams commencing at plate  diagram v show the theoretical method of reducing vacant spaces by the sacrifice of stones this series is taken from korschelt and the position as it arose in actual play is s

	
hown on plate   depicting a complete game in plate  diagram v the white group is shown externally surrounded and the black stone has just been played at s  rendering the group hopeless the same group is shown on the opposite side of the board at plat

d but it consisted mostly of collections of illustrative and annotated games and the go masters seem to have had a desire to make their marginal annotations as brief as possible in order to compel the beginner to go to the master for instruction and 

	
ntersection and then adds two more stones until the situation shown in plate  diagram iv arises then white must again play at s  in order to save his stones from immediate capture and the situation shown at plate  diagram i comes about black again pl

	
ays at j   adds one more stone and we have the situation shown in plate  diagram ii where it is obvious that white must play at c  in order to save his group from immediate capture thus leaving only two vacant spaces it is unnecessary to continue the

	
 analysis further but at the risk of explaining what is apparent it might be pointed out that black would play on one of these vacant spaces and if white killed the stone which it would not pay white to do black would play again on the space thus mad

	
e vacant and completely surround and kill the entire white group  a group with five vacant me  as shown in the preceding diagrams is a situation well known to the japanese so much so that they have a special phrase or saying that applies to it to wit

	
eries of moves would not be played out white obviously would not play in the space and he could not demand that black play therein in order to complete the actual surrounding of the stones and the only purpose of giving this series of diagrams is to 

	
show theoretically how the white stones can be killed however the killing of these stones would be necessary if the surrounding black line were in turn attacked  semeai  in which case it might be a race to see whether the internal white stones could 

	
be completely surrounded and killed before the external white group could get in complete contact with the black line  stones which are sacrificed in order to kill a larger group are called sute ishi by the japanese from suteru  meaning to cast or th

	
row away  and ishi  a stone  it may be noted that if a group contains four connected vacant intersections in a line it is safe because if the adversary attempts to reduce it two disconnected me can be formed in the space by simply playing a stone adj

	
ficient for the purpose provided the fourth me is connected at the end of the three and the japanese express this by their saying magari shimoku wa me  or four me turning a corner neither does it make any difference whether the four connected me are 

	
in the center of the board or along the edge on plate  diagrams iv and v are examples of magari shimoku wa me  and they both are safe it is interesting however to compare these situations with that shown at plate  diagram ii where the fourth intersec

	
tion is not connected at the end of the line and which group black can kill if it is his move as we already have seen  if however such a group contains only three connected vacant intersections and it is the adversary s move it can be killed because 

	
the adversary by playing on the middle intersection can prevent the formation of two disconnected me  we saw a group of this kind on plate  diagram ix which can be killed by playing at n   obviously if it is black s move in this case the group can be

	
e can be killed if it is black s move by playing at a  on the other hand if it is white s move he can save them by playing on the same point  of course if a group of stones contains a large number of vacant intersections it is perfectly safe unless t

	
he vacant space is so large that the adversary can have a chance of forming an entire new living group of stones therein  we now come to the one exception to the rule that the players may place their stones at will on any vacant intersection on the b

	
oard this rule is called the rule of ko  and is shown on plate  diagram i assuming that it is white s turn to play he can play at d  and take the black stone at c  which is already surrounded on three sides and the position shown in plate  diagram ii

	
 would then arise it is now white s turn to play and if he plays at c   the white stone which has just been put down will be likewise surrounded and could be at once taken from the board black however is not permitted to do this immediately but must 

	
e battle and in which the victory or defeat was brought about by the courage of single noblemen rather than through the fighting of the common soldiers  go on the other hand is not merely a picture of a single battle like chess but of a whole campaig

	
 permitted to take and retake the stones as shown in the diagram the series of moves would be endless and the game could never be finished it is something like perpetual check in chess but the japanese in place of calling the game a draw compel the s

	
econd player to move elsewhere and thus allow the game to continue in an actual game when a player is prevented from retaking a stone by the rule of ko  he always tries to play in some other portion of the board where he threatens a larger group of s

 another group can be threatened and so on sometimes in a hotly contested game the battle will rage around a place where ko occurs and the space will be taken and retaken several times  korschelt states that the ideograph for ko means talent or skilf

	
vantage of this rule with much greater ingenuity it is a good idea for the weaker player as far as possible to avoid situations where its application arises  there is a situation which sometimes arises and which might be mistaken for ko  it is where 

	
a player takes more than one stone and the attacking stone is threatened on three sides or where only one stone is taken but the adversary in replying can take not only the last stone played but others also in these cases the opponent can retake imme

rd from the seki in the phrase jo seki  seki also is somewhat analogous to perpetual check it arises when a vacant space is surrounded partly by white and partly by black stones in such a way that if either player places a stone therein his adversary

	
 can thereupon capture the entire group under these circumstances of course neither player desires to place a stone on that portion of the board and the rules of the game do not compel him to do so that portion of the board is regarded as neutral ter

ame  it is a rule of the game to give warning when a stone or group of stones is about to be completely surrounded for this purpose the japanese use the word atari  from ataru  to touch lightly  which corresponds quite closely to the expression garde

	
ies are cut off from their line of communications and are taken prisoners unless they can fortify themselves in impregnable positions and a far-reaching strategy alone assures the victory  it is difficult to say which of the two games gives more plea

	
he etiquette of the old japan  the game comes to an end when the frontiers of the opposing groups are in contact this does not mean that the board is entirely covered for the obvious reason that the space inside the groups or chains of stones is purp

	
osely left vacant for that is the only part of the board which counts but so long as there is any vacant space lying between the opposing groups that must be disposed of in some way and when it is so disposed of it will be found that the white and bl

	
ack groups are in complete contact  just at the end of the game there will be found isolated vacant intersections or me on the frontier lines and it does not make any difference which player fills these up they are called by the japanese dame  which 

	
means useless  the word dame is likely to be confusing when it is first heard because the beginner jumps to the conclusion that it is some new kind of a me  this arises from a coincidence only anything that is useless or profitless is called dame in 

	
same word that is used to designate the intersections but its recurrence in this connection is merely an accident  it is difficult for the beginner at first to understand why the filling of these dame results in no advantage to either player and begi

	
nners often fill up such spaces even before the end of the game feeling that they are gaining ground slowly but surely and the japanese have a saying  heta go ni dame nashi  which means that there are no dame in beginners go as beginners do not recog

	
nize their uselessness on the other hand a necessary move will sometimes look like dame  the moves that are likely to be so confused are the final connecting moves or tsugu  where a potential connection has been made early in the game but which need 

	
to be filled up to complete the chain in the illustrative game number i the dame are all given but a little practice is necessary before they can always be recognized  when the dame have been filled and the dead stones have been removed from the boar

	
sure the combinations in go suffer in comparison with those of chess by reason of a certain monotony because there are no pieces having different movements and because the stones are not moved again after once being placed on the board also to a begi

	
er the japanese do not do this immediately but purely for the purpose of facilitating the count the player having the white pieces would fill up his adversary s territory with the black stones he had captured as far as they would go and the player ha

	
ving the black stones would fill up his adversary s territory with the white stones that he had captured and thereupon the entire board is reconstructed so that the vacant spaces come into rows of fives and tens so that they are easier to count this 

	
has really nothing to do with the game and it is merely a device to make the counting of the spaces easier but it seems like a mysterious process to a novice and adds not a little to the general mystery with which the end of the game seems to be surr

	
ounded when an occidental sees it played for the first time this process of arrangement is called me wo tsukuru  it may be added that if any part of the board contains the situation called seki  that portion is left alone and is not reconstructed lik

	
opeless as it is cut off in every direction the same is true of the white stone at b   it is not so easy to see that the black stones at l and m   n o p q and r   n   and m and n  are dead but against a good player they would have no hope of forming 

	
the necessary two me  and they are therefore conceded to be dead but a good player could probably manage to defend them against a novice it is still more difficult to see why the irregular white group of eighteen stones on the left-hand side of the b

 will give further illustrations of the difficulty and nicety of such decisions  we now come to the question of handicaps handicaps are given by the stronger player allowing the weaker player to place a certain number of stones on the board before th

	
e game begins and we have seen in the chapter on the description of the board that these stones are placed on the nine dotted intersections if one stone is given it is usual to place it in the upper right-hand corner if a second stone is given it is 

	
placed in the lower left-hand corner if a third stone is given it is placed in the lower right-hand corner the fourth is placed in the upper left-hand corner the fifth is placed at the center or ten gen  when six are given the center one is removed a

	
ghth stones are placed on the seimoku on line k if the ninth is given it is again placed in the center of the board  between players of reasonable skill more than nine stones are never given but when the disparity between the players is too great fou

	
r other stones are sometimes given they are placed just outside the corner seimoku  as shown on the diagram plate   and these extra stones are called furin handicaps  furin means a small bell  as these stones suggest to the japanese the bells which h

	
ang from the eaves at the corners of a japanese temple when the disparity between the players is very great indeed sometimes four more stones are given and when given they are placed on the diagonal halfway between the corner seimoku and the center t

	
hese four stones are called naka yotsu  or the four middle stones  but such a handicap could only be given to the merest novice  we have now completed a survey of all the actual rules of the game and it may be well to summarize them in order that the

	
 chess openings guide our play in that game stones so played in the opening are called joseki by the japanese nevertheless i think that in the early part of the game the play is somewhat indefinite for any player of ordinary skill on the other hand t

	
hey are played they are not moved again    a one or more stones which are compactly surrounded by the stones of the other side are said to be taken and are at once removed from the board  b stones which while not actually surrounded can inevitably be

	
 surrounded are dead and can be taken from the board at the end of the game without further play  c taken or dead stones are used to fill up the adversary s territory   the game is at an end when the opposing groups of stones are in absolute contact 

	
the case of seki being the single exception  it is not possible to imagine a game with simpler rules or the elements of which are easier to acquire  we will now turn our attention to a few considerations as to the best methods of play and of certain 

	
moves and formations which occur in every game and also to the names which in japanese are used to designate these things     iv general methods of play and terminology of the game  as will be shown more in detail in the chapter on openings or joseki

	
ack it is also easier to form territory in the corners of the board next to the corners of the board the sides of the board are easiest to defend and territory is more easily formed along the sides than in the center and in an ordinary game the play 

	
generally proceeds from the corners and edges to the center the importance which the japanese attach to the corners is shown by their saying yo sumi torarete go wo utsu na  or  if the four corners are taken cease playing  against a good player it is 

	
next to impossible to form territory in the center of the board unless it is based on one of the sides or corners  there is however an old rule of etiquette which is not consistent with this theory of the opening it used to be regarded as exceedingly

	
 impolite and insulting to play the first stone on the handicap point in the center of the board called ten gen  it has been explained to me that the reason for this rule is that such a move was supposed to assure the victory to the first player and 

	
hese considerations are balanced by the greater number of combinations and by the greater number of places on the board where conflicts take place as a rule it may be said that two average players of about equal strength will find more pleasure in go

	
 was regarded as evidence of his great skill it has however been shown by honinbo dosaku that this move gives the first player no decisive advantage and i have been also told by some japanese that the reason that this move is regarded as impolite is 

	
because it is a wasted move and implies a disrespect for the adversary s skill and from what experience i have had in the game i think the latter explanation is more plausible at all events such a move is most unusual and can only be utilized by a pl

	
ayer of the highest skill  when good players commence the game from the first they have in mind the entire board and they generally play a stone in each of the four corners and one or two around the edges of the board sketching out as it were the ter

	
ritory which they ultimately hope to obtain they do not at once attack each other s stones and it is not until the game is well advanced that anything like a hand to hand conflict occurs beginners are likely to engage at once in a close conflict thei

	
er the board there is no surer indication of the play of a novice than this it is just as if a battle were to commence without the guidance of a commanding officer by indiscriminate fisticuffs among the common soldiers of the other extreme or ji dori

	
 go  we have already spoken another way in which the play of experts may be recognized is that all the stones of a good player are likely to be connected in one or at most two groups while poorer players find their stones divided up into small groups

	
 each of which has to struggle to form the necessary two me in order to insure survival  assuming that we have advanced far enough to avoid premature encounters or ji dori go  and are placing our stones in advantageous positions decently and in order

	
 the question arises how many spaces can be safely skipped from stone to stone in advancing our frontiers that is to say how far can stones be separated and yet be potentially connected and therefore safe against attack the answer is that two spaces 

	
 than in chess for in chess it is almost certain that the first of two such players who loses a piece will lose the game and further play is mostly an unsuccessful struggle against certain defeat in go on the other hand a severe loss does not by any

           q   r                 p   takes  there are other continuations but they are still worse for white if however the adversary s stones are already posted on the line of advance sometimes it is only safe to skip one point and of course in clos

	
e positions the stones must be played so that they are actually connected the japanese call this skipping of me by the terms ikken tobi  nikken tobi  sangen tobi  etc  which literally means to fly one two or three spaces  although this is plain enoug

	
h these relations are nevertheless shown on plate   diagrams i ii and iii when stones of opposite colors on the same line are separated by vacant space in a similar way diagram iv  then the terms ikken kakari  nikken kakari  etc  are used  kakari rea

s this is so because if black plays at l  or n  white can immediately kill the stone this joining on the edge of the board is called by the special term watari  which means to cross over  sometimes we find the word watari used when the connection bet

s  it is called haneru  which really means the flourish which is made in finishing an ideograph  we will now take up a few of the other words that are used by the japanese as they play the game by far the most frequent of these are tsugu  kiru  nobir

	
r   if on the other hand black should play on both these points the white stones would be forever separated and this cutting off is called kiru  although as a rule when such a situation is worthy of comment one of the intersections has already been f

	
illed by the attacking player plate   diagram xiii illustrates kiru  where if a black stone is played at q   the white stones are separated  kiru means to cut  and is recognizable as one of the component parts of that much abused and mispronounced wo

 great a victory  before proceeding with the technical chapters on the illustrative games openings etc  it may be well to say a word in regard to the method adopted for keeping a record of the game the japanese do this by simply showing a picture of 

	
the finished game on which each stone is numbered as it was played if a stone is taken and another stone is put in its place an annotation is made over the diagram of the board with a reference to that intersection stating that such a stone has been 

	
taken in ko  such a method with the necessary marginal annotation is good enough but it is very hard to follow as there is no means of telling where any stone is without searching all over the board for it and while the japanese are very clever at th

is chimney down  ben looked up at the massive pillar of brick which reared itself above him  it looks about a mile high when you stand close to it why  he added with a blank look  it ll take us months to level it   you was a-calculatin to level it  m

	
undon laconically asked  of course how else can we work over the bricks that are in it   um how d you think you d git it down   well--that s what s worrying me i had a sort of plan to scrape down the soot but the bricks--how are we going to get at th

	
em   your idee is good--as fur as it goes but i think i can give you a better one than scrapin the chimney of soot   let s have it   i d rig a cross-piece--shaped just like a cross--to work inside the chimney from a rope over the top like an elevator

	
  ben caught his breath  how would you ever get a rope over the top  he asked  o that s easy i haven t ben a sailor fur nothin  then i d chip off the whole inside of the chimney   we d work just the inside   that s all we want ain t it it s the golde

	
 ben  mundon waited a moment before replying he liked the frank admiration that shone in ben s eyes  there ain t nothin sure in this world ben and it s mighty oncertain sometimes to draw conclusions from things you ve ben told what s more you can t b

	
 lieve all you hear   you re preparing me to be disappointed mundon  said ben  but i m bracing myself for that too i know it s a chance   most everythin is-- cept runnin a peanut-stand near a monkey s cage  ben laughed  how you re ever going to get a

	
 rope over that top  he looked up and shook his head in despair  no fear--i ll manage that just let me get some stuff for a scaffoldin and i ll show you the trick in a jiffy   you re a wonder  ben replied  the question as to what he should have done 

	
without mundon s help occurred to him again but he did not express it  i heard when i was up town this mornin that there was goin to be a sale of mules to-morrow   you think we ll need one to work the arastra   couldn t hev nothin better this sale s

 the figure i had in mind of course i don t ask your opinion mundon so much to get advice as i do to compare notes i like to see if your judgment and mine agree  mundon did not look up but went steadily on with his work  i understand--of course  he r

	
eplied   chapter vi the mule auction  a mule is very much like a horse isn t it  ben questioned on the following morning  yes they are somewhat similar  mundon replied going on with the task of untangling some old harness  yet they re different too  

	
 that s so they are  ben did not like to admit his ignorance but he very much desired some further information on the subject of mules before he entered the arena of the auction he had a guilty consciousness that he had made mundon feel that he resen

	
ted his superior wisdom in many things connected with their undertaking and that he was unreasonably jealous of his worldly knowledge he regretted and was ashamed of his ingratitude toward this man who had proved invaluable to him and he hoped that t

	
chest but of course these don t hold good in a mule   no i suppose not   then he oughter be in good perportion i ve seen horses with a fine-lookin front and a back all shrunk up and i ve seen some with a fine back and a front that had a stunted look 

	
an animal like that ain t apt to have much strength or wearin qualities then there s exceptions i remember one of the best horses for pullin i ever saw had a sort of stunted front but of course none of these things hold good in a mule   no nothing se

	
ems to apply to a mule  ben picked up a strap which dangled from the harness and began untangling it  haven t the teeth something to do with it   sure they re the most important point  cause that s the way you kin tell a horse s age--by his teeth if 

	
they re long he s old you want to see that they ain t ben filed too   do you think the point about the teeth would apply to a mule  ben asked  there ain t nothin that applies to a mule except--patience you ve got to have everlastin patience when you 

	
u found it on his land   no  twouldn t not any more his than mine the works were just a mill to crush everybody s ore and what s left is for the sweeper besides the land is only leased anyway and if i go open-handed and buy the right to sweep what i 

	
s was out of my mouth sal would be a-standin way off from the bank and all i had to do to git one of em over the chain --there s a chain runs between em in place of a pole you know and mebbe i d have sixteen or twenty strung along in pairs --and if i

	
 wanted to git one of em over it i d jest call out the name and that mule would jump the chain quick as lightnin  a horse has got a heap of sense but in my opinion a mule kin discount him every time   we re safer then in buying a mule than a horse   

	
law yes for the work you want done you are   well i ll be going along i guess  remarked ben  i want to look over the field before the sale begins   that d be a good idee  ben boarded an electric car which crossed the city he was dubious as to his abi

	
lity for the task he had undertaken and regretted that he had not asked mundon to go in his place he ran over the directions for buying a horse  round-hoofed small-eared broad-headed clear-eyed short-teethed clean-legged wide-chested and good-proport

	
 so and he was so well qualified to select exactly the animal needed  he had appeared anxious to get ben out of the way could it be possible that he meant to make the attempt to get the rope over the top of the chimney during his absence how would he

	
 manage it it seemed a colossal impossible task  the car clanged its bell along kearny street whizzed across market and swung into third street on its way to the potrero a wild idea occurred to ben  if there s a mule in the inclosure that points his 

	
ears at me i ll buy him  he decided  association with his father had implanted superstition in the boy s character ben had seen it sway his father many times as indeed it exerted an influence more or less potent upon all miners  a recollection of the

	
 sum he had resolved to expend reminded ben that the occult must be confined within the limits of fifteen dollars  i don t know the first thing about it anyway and i might as well be guided by chance as anything else  he reflected  he was a trifle as

	
find s mine   i should think that some of it would be his too   i don t see it that way a girl s always got such cranky ideas of business   well we won t quarrel about it until you get it shall you put in all your money   every cent if i have to i d 

	
lorn-looking specimen of a mule raised two weather-beaten ears and disconsolately surveyed him  that settles it  said ben to himself  after all it s something to have the matter decided for one  the man in charge was anxious to show ben the superior 

	
animals within the inclosure but he manifested so little interest in them that their owner began to have doubts as to his being a bona fide purchaser  like as not the rest will all go above my price  thought ben  but i think i can get despair -- for 

	
so he had designated the mule he had settled upon-- for fifteen  it was a long wait and ben was anxious to return to the works but the owner seemed to be in no hurry to begin and evidently was waiting for a larger audience  when a dozen or more men h

	
ad arrived the sale was opened it was confusing the way in which the auctioneer rattled on discovering invisible buyers in corners and on the outskirts of the crowd  ben wondered how he should be able to keep his head when his time should come and he

	
you can t tell anything by looks but i don t believe he d do that  it was late in the afternoon before the mule which ben had selected--or rather the mule which had selected ben--was offered  we ll start him at-- what ll we start him at gentlemen   f

	
ive dollars  said a voice  five dollars  the auctioneer scornfully repeated  somebody here expects to get a good workin animal for nothing just because his coat s a little rough five dollars would be just a-givin him away why all he needs to be a pla

	
ymate for the children is a clippin and a red ribbon tied round his tail what am i bid bid bid--what am i bid ten dollars young man did you say  he pointed to ben and the latter nodded  here s a young gentleman who knows a good animal for the saddle 

	
when he sees one  this sally brought a laugh from the crowd and added to ben s discomfiture  ten dollars who ll raise the bid twelve  he pointed to a man on the edge of the group  who ll give me twelve dollars for this reliable mule twelve dollars   

	
like mighty well to have some left though for the expense of working the thing   o ben suppose you shouldn t find any gold   that s the chance i ve got to take but you shall have anything you want beth  her face flushed as she saw him glance at her s

	
e here wants this mule more than this young gentleman fifteen once--fifteen twice--fifteen three times and sold to-- --he turned expectantly toward ben -- mr --  ralston  said ben  the money was paid and ben started for the works with his purchase  y

	
ou must hev wanted that mule powerful bad young feller  a bystander remarked as the pair issued from the gate  think so  the boy replied anxious to make his escape  yes--it rather looks as though you did to wait till the last and worst-lookin mule in

	
 the bunch was offered  the man continued  and then to raise your own bid twice  there was a laugh from the crowd  you could hev got him for twelve dollars sure and you might hev got him for ten   well that s my affair  ben retorted  he led the mule 

	
along a street in the direction of the city not without a misgiving however as to the docility of the animal a fear that he might balk or suddenly whirl and kick to the amusement of the spectators made ben eager to increase the distance between the m

	
treets as he trudged along the mule seemed docile and easily led but ben bought some carrots from a passing vegetable-wagon to make assurance doubly sure  he regretted that he had yielded to the impulse of trusting to chance he was conscious that the

	
 act was unworthy and degrading that he had taken a step backward  if i m going to act in that fool way  he said to himself  there s no telling where i ll land it s as bad as the things tom sawyer did --worse because he didn t trust an important piec

	
e of business to black art it s just the kind of thing that the lowest order of a negro would be capable of but no one knows it  he added with emphasis  nor ever shall  despair and i can keep the secret that name won t do--it might hoodoo the scheme 

	
 he turned and reflectively surveyed the mule  you ve got to have a name that s a winner a cheerful humming booming sort of a name  he said  as if in reply the animal raised his long ears and pointed them at his interlocutor  when they reached montgo

	
the whole town s seeing every move i make  the boy reflected  but it makes a heap of difference in people s opinions whether you succeed or not if you don t then you re looked upon as a fool and everything you ve done is fool-business but if you do t

	
hen you re called wise and everything you ve done is smart as lightning  they reached the slight rise and began to descend toward the bay outlined against the vista of the blue water washing the base of the sausalito hills rose the massive pillar of 

	
the chimney  ben paused an instant in amazement mundon had been true to his word for reaching from the top to the bottom was a cable that looked the thickness of a thread against the solid round bulk of the chimney  ben could hardly believe his eyes 

	
how had it been accomplished  he was obliged to control his impatience until the mule s deliberate gait brought them at length to the works  mundon where are you  ben called as he dashed into the building  ahoy there  a voice replied from the flue  p

	
d we ll drive the first blow  ben retreated and mundon struck the chisel he held a blow that sent down a shower of soot broken brick and mortar  we ll soon know now  ben said to himself and his heart beat rapidly when he thought of all it meant to hi

	
m   chapter vii building the arastra  we ve got to find a place to keep the mule it s too cold to leave him outside  said ben  that s easy  mundon replied  one of the sheds ll do first-rate he ll have a box-stall --same as a racer   i ll fix it up fo

	
r him right now he looks sort of forlorn tied out there in the fog  said ben  there s two other animals we ought to find quarters for too   two others o you mean ourselves   yes with all this room goin to waste why shouldn t we get our room rent free

	
   that s a good idea mundon we ll have to do it or hire a watchman as soon as we begin to work the stuff we might as well get used to it first as last   i ll build the room for us over there against that east wall will be a good place for it   perha

	
ay to fix it   don t anger mr hodges will you ben  she turned an anxious face toward him  i won t i didn t tell you that i found a note of his for ninety dollars among father s papers   no you don t expect to get it   of course not but i can hold it 

	
till we know to the contrary we ll have to have some furniture i suppose   furniture   why a couple of beds anyway   o i ll knock up a couple of bunks that ll do for the time we ll be here i can make first-rate arm-chairs too --reg lar sleepy hollers

	
 --out of those barrels   that ll be fine i suppose we d better use the boards out of that first shed   no i d put the mule in that one then he d be farther away from our quarters i d knock down the second shed the one where the roof is half gone fou

	
nd a name yet fur your mule   i ve named him alchemist    alchymist  don t that mean turnin no count things inter gold   yes   well that s propriate  cause he ll work the rastra then we kin call him alchy till we know the result and if we don t get a

	
nythin worth mentionin out of it we kin call him missed  that ll be propriate too   alchy goes then and here s to be his home i think i ll leave one window for his professorship we ll separate his apartments from ours  he struck the dilapidated shed

n pointed to some bricks which marked the location of the furnaces  i was calculatin to but first we ve got to remember that we ve got to have a furnace too   we have what for   why we ve got to melt our gold--after we git it   o well why not leave t

	
hat part of the old furnace that s standing there   i was a-thinkin of doin that we ll build a rough chimney on the outside   then we ll have to have a crucible   yes that s another thing i was goin to mention ever seen it done--gold melted in one

 corner a circle  said ben as he placed a brick upon the spot indicated  you kin corner anythin  if you only find out how to do it there  he added with satisfaction  the first brick s laid now she ll go a-hummin   let me help you  said ben  it s more

	
 interesting than building the mule-shed i can fix that by-and-by   all right  mundon watched ben lay the bricks  how clumsy i am  the latter exclaimed when the bricks refused to lie evenly  i ve often watched bricklayers at work it looks as easy as 

	
breathing but it isn t --not by a long sight   it s a trade  mundon laconically remarked  then you must be jack of them all  said ben  for there s nothing you can t do   i ve ben in most of em it s mean to try to do things when you don t know how som

cause it s work you like that s the reason but it takes some folks a lifetime to find that out and even then they don t see it  ben was looking at the pile of rubble as if fascinated  how much longer before we know   it won t be long now i reckon   o

s inquirin  bout the price of quicksilver i run up against a man as knew all about this sort of thing--or said he did  course i didn t tell him our plan but what he says is needed fur it is a jigger   a what   a jigger machine i got him to describe i

	
 said  well really it s a tank--six foot long by four high you fill it with water at one end you have a tray filled with dirt and hung from a pole which is balanced by a weight at the end t other end of the pole works up and down like the handle of a

	
 bellus the tray is dipped into the tank and all the loose dirt is washed out and the gold sinks to the bottom that s the coarse gold you ve got to ketch the fine gold on a table in the tank under the tray the waste dirt works inter the fur part of t

	
he tank this man says--and he seems ter know what he s talkin about--that you can t git the val able particles nohow without a jigger   what luck you were in to meet him   wasn t i though i believe i ll git the lumber --it oughter be made out of new 

	
lumber --and knock the thing together this afternoon  mundon replied as he walked to the rear wall of the building  say ben  he remarked picking up a little of the earth from the floor and letting it sift through his fingers  i think we oughter locat

and-cars and run em on a track  he suddenly knelt down and ran his hand along the ground in front of the excavations  here s the groove where the track was laid --sure s you re born  ben dropped beside him  there is a groove  he cried  we re regular 

	
detectives mundon   it couldn t run anywhere else  the other said as if to himself  than to the bullion-room of course it couldn t and it didn t it ran over there didn t it  ben pointed to the opposite wall  yes  said mundon  it must my they were car

hile before anybody found it out then p raps they d run tons of base bullion inter a trench thinkin they d go over the ground when they got time um-- well sometimes they never got the time they was so busy makin money we must look round some time fur

	
 traces of a trench of that sort   i ve got an idea  said ben  that it would be a good plan to wash the soil here and there with an ordinary gold-pan we could tell something i should think about where the richest dirt lay then   twouldn t do no harm 

	
but the richest dirt is bound ter be near the furnaces and in the bullion-room we ll finish with the chimney first  cause if there are any nuggets they ll be there   wouldn t any tin pan do   o you better have the real thing i see one a-hangin up out

 to shake the pan from side to side allowing a little water to flow constantly from the top until a small amount of very ordinary-looking dirt remained in the bottom it was exhilarating to think of what it might contain  it looks exactly like the mud

shook his head  i ain t that kind  he remarked as he returned to his work of constructing the jigger  after all  he continued  you can t tell much about it till you make the speriment in the proper way this machine ll settle it one way or the other  

	
ery funny  said ben  i was just thinking that we ll have to ship our bullion--when we get it--up to the searby smelting works at vallejo to be resmelted and cast into bars they were the original owners of it   funny enough for us  mundon replied  but

	
 i don t count on shippin  em any   how ll we get it into bars   i ll git it into bars myself you didn t know that i was an assayer too did you   no  ben thoughtfully replied  i think i ve found my trade at last mundon if i ve got brains enough i ll

amalgam he sent it after the cap  here young feller don t you go plumb crazy that s heavy want ter kill us give me that ball--i ain t through with it yet  ben returned the ball  i had to let off steam or bust  he said  now we ll see what we ll see  s

	
i say mundon i d have made a pretty fizzle of this business without you   you d have had to found somebody else that s all  mundon modestly replied  next i take the retort --see that it s cold --and chalk it well watch me ben --most anybody can set a

 ben as they lifted it to the furnace and he concluded that mundon had asked him to help him in order that he might feel that he was more than a spectator  he s got the finest feelings  ben said to himself  he s always trying to make a fellow feel co

	
mfortable  they built a roaring fire in the furnace  now you kin tend that fire fur two hours ben  said mundon  while i go down-town and see bout gittin some more coal and a few little things we need i ll be right back don t forget--you got to keep t

	
 the tanks and shovel it out just as if they were shoveling coal   they must have lost a lot   it couldn t be helped and no one s ever worked it over   what was that   nothing but a loose shingle in the roof why beth i didn t know you were such a cow

h so irritated ben that he relieved his feelings by flinging shovelfuls of coal into the furnace  the two hours were nearly up and mundon must soon return  one of the self-invited visitors proved to be a reporter who walked about notebook in hand sca

ppeared to come from the corner of the building in which the jigger was situated and ben concluded that the man was searching there for the gold feeling that he could keep quiet no longer ben grasped mundon s arm  hush  he whispered  don t speak some

g laughter of the crowd over his failure and this added to his nervousness his cheeks were flushed with excitement and he stole over to where beth and little sue were standing and said in an anxious whisper  it s just awful not to know how it s going

	
 to pan out  when at length the crucial moment arrived and he saw mundon scoop up some particles of yellow metal with one hand while with the other he waved his hat everything seemed to swim before ben s eyes  the crowd gave a hearty cheer in which h

approvingly replied his seventeen-year-old vanity was flattered by being called a man  you see  he continued  if i d been taught a trade it would be different or if father had had any business to leave me but he was just like old madge --wouldn t do

se of the other two about the same small quantity of gold-sponge remained in the crucible and the crowd seemed slightly disappointed  that little bit wouldn t make anybody very envious  remarked ben  in fact i doubt if most people would work as hard 

	
as we have for it   you think it wouldn t but you don t know much bout envy and you don t know men this is the stuff  mundon said as he carefully took the gold from the crucible  be it much or little of it that makes wild beasts of men  most all the

 out of a job for some time he was a desperate man with a family depending on him and he went as skipper fully conscious of what was expected of him he did it like a man he let the doge of venice founder in a north sea gale and by a marvelous chance 

	
managed to save his ship s company at the inquiry of course he was made scapegoat and he didn t contrive to save his ticket they suspended his master s certificate for a year on the strength of that he applied to owners for maintenance putting it on 

	
the reasonable claim of services rendered owners being upright merchants and sensible men naturally repudiated all knowledge or liability said he was a blackmailing scoundrel as well as an unskilful seaman and threatened him with an action for libel 

	
 and he was just a terror with his men he simply kept alive by carrying his fist on a revolver-butt there isn t a man who s served with red kettle three weeks that wouldn t have cheerfully swung for the enjoyment of murdering him   you appear to know

n all who come in contact with me there is never any good born out of words voiced in anger mr onslow has seen fit to mention a few of your shall i say eccentricities just to show er that we understand one another   to show he s got his knife in me m

	
 must know i m the deuce of a stickler for my own personal comfort and convenience you can bet i haven t been talking at you through gratuitous cruelty but mr shelf and i have got a yarn to bring out directly which is a bit of a coarse tough-fibered 

	
yarn and we didn t want you to give it a top-dressing of varnish so by way of safeguard i pointed out to you that if we show ourselves to be sinners you needn t sing out that you find yourself in evil company for the first time  mr theodore shelf had

	
 been shuffling his feet uneasily for some time onslow s method of speech jarred him to the verge of profanity his own saintliness was a garb which he never threw entirely away at any moment his voice had always the oily drone of the conventicle his 

	
smug hypocrisy was a perennial source of pride and comfort to him without which he would have felt very lonely and abandoned  at this point he drew the conversation into his own hands it had been said of him that he always addressed the house of comm

oundrel believes that he can lay up a stock of fire insurance of this sort which will comfortably see him through future efforts in kettle s mind however shipowners were a vastly different class of beings and so it never occurred to him that the same

	
 might apply to them  in this attitude captain kettle listened to the sermon which was reeled out to him and rather gathered that the project he was exhorted to take part in was in some obscure manner a missionary enterprise promoted solely in the ho

	
vely he was so perfect that just for experiment i altered my step by degrees you know automatically and without anything being seen he changed too and we were dancing the old slow glide before i knew and his steering was perfect in that whirling teem

	
ping firm was too fearful of interruptions from his partner to give any opening for a syllable of comment  but if captain owen kettle was unversed in the finer niceties of the art of hypocrisy he was a man of angular common-sense and by degrees it da

	
wned upon him that mr shelf s project when removed of its top-dressing of religion was in its naked self something very different from what he had at first been drawn to believe  as this idea grew upon him the devotional droop faded from the corners 

	
of his lips and his mouth drew to a hard straight line scarcely to be distinguished amongst the curving bristles of hair which surrounded it but he made no interruption and drank in every word till the speaker had delivered the whole of his say then 

	
he uttered his decision  so gentlemen you are standing in as partners over this precious business and because you know me to be a poor broke man with a wife and family you naturally think you can buy me to work for you off the straight well perhaps t

	
rled shelf  do you mean to threaten me   no i don t i just gave you my own opinion as from man to man just because i respect myself but i m not going round to your place of worship to shout it out to them that sit under you they wouldn t believe me i

	
f i did not now at any rate besides it wouldn t do me any good and i couldn t afford it i m a needy man mr shelf as you have guessed and that s why i m going to accept your offer but don t let us have any misunderstanding between ourselves as to what

	
 it foots up to what i m going to sign on for directly when you hand me the papers is a spell of piracy on the high seas neither more nor less and i m going to have my money all paid down in advance before i ring an engine-bell on your blasted tramp 

	
of a steamer i guess that s fair enough my family ll want something to go on with if i m caught because if one s found out at this game it s just a common ordinary hanging matter yes sir swing by the neck till i m dead as an ax and may heaven have me

perhaps  said onslow  he won t have the chance other hands on that steamer will have to share the secret in whole or in part perhaps they won t all of them come through it alive if you remember that we are plotting deliberate piracy on the high seas 

	
you will recognize that there is precedent for a considerable percentage of casualties  the city man shuddered through the double windows came the sullen roar of a london street and in imagination he seemed to distinguish the howl of the crowd joined

	
 in execration against him  his eye fell upon a paper on the desk it was the formal notice from her bankers that his wife s account was heavily overdrawn he lifted the paper and tore it with his teeth and then he smote the table with a shut fist so t

	
ink and they turn me sick but at whatever cost we must go through with the affair it is necessary that i make a heavy coup within the next month or the consequences may be disastrous   marmaduke rivers and shelf will go down quite so i m also at the 

	
end of my cash balance so that money seems to be the impelling power for each of us but come now wake up sir and let s get on with the business i m not so sweet on this city atmosphere of yours that i care to spend another morning down here if it can

	
 be avoided how are you going to raise the specie   i ll proceed about it at once  said shelf pressing another of the buttons on his desk  you may as well witness every step of the process  in answer to the bell fairfax came into the room nodded rath

the port edes in dock the insurance policy on the money will be deposited with the bank to secure them in full for the loan itself and for their other charges the credit of the house will easily suffice is that clear   perfectly  said fairfax  but i 

	
should like to remind you of one thing wharf thefts at new orleans are notorious and you ll have to pay heavily to insure against them   i know more heavily than for risks across the ocean and the run up the river underwriters are justly nervous abou

 risks by the way as the port edes is merely a cargo tramp and doesn t hold a certificate for passengers i m afraid the board of trade would not let mr onslow travel by her simply as the firm s representative but that could be easily overcome   oh  s

 fist and his eyes gazing out over the tumbling waters and yet they say there used to be poetry in a craft of that sort whilst there never was and never will be with a steamer i suppose the reason is that a poet has to be a man who knows nothing what

	
ever about what he writes upon i know that some chaps who string verses nowadays have been on a steamboat and smelt the smells of her and seen her lines and watched the men who do the work and yet they make no poetry about it but of the old crew who

and it couldn t be explained away man as you know the thing s as big as a sluice-gate   all the bilge pumps in the gulf of mexico couldn t make headway against that valve once it was fairly opened it s the quickest and cleverest way of scuttling a st

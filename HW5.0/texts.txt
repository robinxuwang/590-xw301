it isespecially designed to assist students of the game who have acquired asmattering of it in some way and who wish to investigate it further attheir leisure 
as far as i know there is no work in the english language on the gameof go as played in japan 
there is an article on the chinese game by z volpicelli in vol 
xxvi of the journal of the china branch of theroyal asiatic society this article i have not consulted 
there isalso a short description of the japanese game in a work on koreangames with notes on the corresponding games of china and japan bystewart culin but this description would be of little practical use inlearning to play the game 
there is however an exhaustive treatise on the game in german by o korschelt 
this can be found in parts of the mittheilungen derdeutschen gesellschaft f r natur- und v lkerkunde ostasiens thestudent could readily learn the game from herr korschelt s article ifit were available but his work has not been translated and it isobtainable only in a few libraries in this country 
in the preparationof this book i have borrowed freely from herr korschelt s work especially in the chapter devoted to the history of the game and ihave also adopted many of his illustrative games and problems 
herr korschelt was an excellent player and acquired his knowledge ofthe game from murase shuho who was the best player in japan at thetime his article was written about 
my acquaintance with the game has been acquired from mr mokichinakamura a japanese resident of this country who is an excellentplayer and whose enthusiasm for the game led me to attempt this book 
mr nakamura has also supplied much of the material which i have usedin it 
toward the end i have had the expert assistance of mr jiheihashiguchi with whom readers of the new york sun are alreadyacquainted 
wherever possible i have given the japanese words and phrases which areused in playing the game and for those who are not familiar with thesystem of writing japanese with roman characters i may say that theconsonants have the sounds used in english and the vowels the soundsthat are used in italian all the final vowels being sounded 
thus  dame is pronounced as though spelled dahmay  new york april 
introductionthe game of go belongs to the class of games of which our chess thoughvery dissimilar is an example 
it is played on a board and is a gameof pure skill into which the element of chance does not enter moreover it is an exceedingly difficult game to learn and no one canexpect to acquire the most superficial knowledge of it without manyhours of hard work 
it is said in japan that a player with ordinaryaptitude for the game would have to play ten thousand games in order toattain professional rank of the lowest degree 
when we think that itwould take twenty-seven years to play ten thousand games at the rate ofone game per day we can get some idea of the japanese estimate of itsdifficulty 
the difficulty of the game and the remarkable amount oftime and labor which it is necessary to expend in order to become evena moderately good player are the reasons why go has not spread toother countries since japan has been opened to foreign intercourse 
forthe same reasons few foreigners who live there have become familiarwith it 
on the other hand its intense interest is attested by the followingsaying of the japanese go uchi wa oya no shini me ni mo awanu whichmeans that a man playing the game would not leave off even to bepresent at the death-bed of a parent 
i have found that beginners inthis country to whom i have shown the game always seem to find itinteresting although so far i have known no one who has progressedbeyond the novice stage 
the more it is played the more its beautiesand opportunities for skill become apparent and it may beunhesitatingly recommended to that part of the community however smallit may be for whom games requiring skill and patience have anattraction 
it is natural to compare it with our chess and it may safely be saidthat go has nothing to fear from the comparison 
indeed it is not toomuch to say that it presents even greater opportunities for foresightand keen analysis 
the japanese also play chess which they call shogi but it isslightly different from our chess and their game has not been so welldeveloped 
go on the other hand has been zealously played and scientificallydeveloped for centuries and as will appear more at length in thechapter on the history of the game it has during part of this time been recognized and fostered by the government 
until recently asystematic treatment of the game such as we are accustomed to in ourbooks on chess has been lacking in japan 
a copious literature hadbeen produced but it consisted mostly of collections of illustrativeand annotated games and the go masters seem to have had a desire tomake their marginal annotations as brief as possible in order tocompel the beginner to go to the master for instruction and to learnthe game only by hard practice 
chess and go are both in a sense military games but the militarytactics that are represented in chess are of a past age in which theking himself entered the conflict his fall generally meaning the lossof the battle and in which the victory or defeat was brought about bythe courage of single noblemen rather than through the fighting of thecommon soldiers 
go on the other hand is not merely a picture of a single battle likechess but of a whole campaign of a modern kind in which thestrategical movements of the masses in the end decide the victory 
battles occur in various parts of the board and sometimes several aregoing on at the same time 
strong positions are besieged and captured and whole armies are cut off from their line of communications and aretaken prisoners unless they can fortify themselves in impregnablepositions and a far-reaching strategy alone assures the victory 
it is difficult to say which of the two games gives more pleasure 
thecombinations in go suffer in comparison with those of chess by reasonof a certain monotony because there are no pieces having differentmovements and because the stones are not moved again after once beingplaced on the board 
also to a beginner the play especially in thebeginning of the game seems vague there are so many points on whichthe stones may be played and the amount of territory obtainable by onemove or the other seems hopelessly indefinite 
this objection is moreapparent than real and as one s knowledge of the game grows itbecomes apparent that the first stones must be played with great care and that there are certain definite advantageous positions whichlimit the player in his choice of moves just as the recognized chessopenings guide our play in that game 
stones so played in the openingare called joseki by the japanese 
nevertheless i think that in theearly part of the game the play is somewhat indefinite for any playerof ordinary skill 
on the other hand these considerations are balancedby the greater number of combinations and by the greater number ofplaces on the board where conflicts take place 
as a rule it may besaid that two average players of about equal strength will find morepleasure in go than in chess for in chess it is almost certain thatthe first of two such players who loses a piece will lose the game andfurther play is mostly an unsuccessful struggle against certain defeat 
in go on the other hand a severe loss does not by any means entailthe loss of the game for the player temporarily worsted can betakehimself to another portion of the field where for the most partunaffected by the reverse already suffered he may gain a compensatingadvantage 
a peculiar charm of go lies in the fact that through the so-called ko an apparently severe loss may often be made a means of securing adecisive advantage in another portion of the board 
a game is so muchthe more interesting the oftener the opportunities for victory ordefeat change and in chess these chances do not change often seldommore than twice 
in go on the other hand they change much morefrequently and sometimes just at the end of the game perhaps in thelast moments an almost certain defeat may by some clever move bechanged into a victory 
there is another respect in which go is distinctly superior to chess 
that is in the system of handicapping 
when handicaps are given inchess the whole opening is more or less spoiled and the scale ofhandicaps from the bishop s pawn to queen s rook is not veryaccurate and in one variation of the muzio gambit so far from being ahandicap it is really an advantage to the first player to give up thequeen s knight 
in go on the other hand the handicaps are in aprogressive scale of great accuracy they have been given from theearliest times and the openings with handicaps have been studied quiteas much as those without handicaps 
in regard to the time required to play a game of go it may be saidthat ordinary players finish a game in an hour or two but as in chess a championship game may be continued through several sittings and maylast eight or ten hours 
there is on record however an authenticaccount of a game that was played for the championship at yeddo duringthe shogunate which lasted continuously nine days and one night 
before taking up a description of the board and stones and the rules ofplay we will first outline a history of the game

it was playedby the chinese from earliest antiquity and has been played in itspresent form by the japanese for over eleven centuries but while thegame originated in china the japanese have far surpassed the chinesein skill at the game and it has come to be regarded in japan as theirnational game 
in the old chinese works three persons are named as the originators ofthe game but in japan its invention is commonly attributed to only oneof these 
this man is the chinese emperor shun who reigned from to b c 
it is said that this emperor invented the game in order tostrengthen the weak mind of his son shang kiun 
by others the inventionof the game is attributed to the predecessor of shun the emperor yao who reigned from to b c 
if this theory is correct it wouldmake the game about forty-two hundred years old 
the third theory isthat wu a vassal of the chinese emperor kieh kwei b c 
invented the game of go 
to the same man is often attributed theinvention of games of cards 
it would seem that this last theory is themost credible because it would make the invention more recent andbecause the inventor is said to have been a vassal and not an emperor 
whatever may be the truth in regard to the origin of the game it isperfectly certain that go was already known in china in earlyantiquity 
in old chinese works of which the oldest is dated about athousand years before christ a game which can be easily recognized asgo is mentioned casually so that at that time it must have been wellknown 
we are told also that in china somewhere about b c poetry and gowent hand in hand and were in high favor and a poet bayu who livedabout the year a d made himself famous through poems in which hesang the praises of the game 
it is remarkable that in the old books it is stated that in the year a d a man by the name of osan was so skilled in go that he couldtake all the stones from the board after the game had been finished andthen play it over from memory 
this is of interest also as showing thatin the course of time playing the game has had the effect ofstrengthening the memory of go players because there are now hundredsof players in japan who can replace a game move for move after it hasbeen disarranged 
it is in fact the customary thing for a teacher ofthe game to play the game over in that way in order to criticise themoves made by the student 
anecdotes have come down to us from the old chinese times in regard tothe game of which we will mention only one which shows how highly itwas esteemed 
sha an a man who lived in the time of the tsin dynasty a d carried on a war with his nephew sha gen 
growing tired of taking life they left the victory to be decided by a game of go which they playedagainst each other 
the esteem in which players were held in the old chinese times is alsoshown by the titles with which they were honored to wit kisei or ki shing from ki meaning go and sei a holy man and shing magician or sage 
in the time of the tang dynasty a d and again during thesung dynasty a d the first books about go were written 
the game then flourished in china and there were then manydistinguished players in that country 
according to the japanese reckoning of time go was introduced intojapan in the period tem pyo during the reign of the emperor shomu which according to the chinese records was the thirteenth year of theperiod tien tao and during the reign of the emperor huan tsung 
according to our calendar this would be about the year a d a man otherwise well known in the history of japan kibi daijin wassent as an envoy to china in that year and it is said that he broughtthe game back with him to japan 
go may have been known in japan before that date but at any rate itmust have been known about this time for in the seventh month of thetenth year of the period tem pyo a d we are told that ajapanese nobleman named kumoshi was playing go with another noblemannamed adzumabito and that in a quarrel resulting from the game kumoshikilled adzumabito with his sword 
on its introduction into japan a new era opened in the development ofthe game but at first it spread very slowly and it is mentioned ahundred years later that the number of go players among the nobility and to them the knowledge of the game was entirely confined was verysmall indeed 
in the period called kasho a d and in nin ju a d a japanese prince dwelt in china and was there taught the gameby the best player in china 
the following anecdote is told in regardto this prince that in order to do him honor the chinese allowed himto meet the best players and in order to cope with them he hit uponthe idea of placing his stones exactly in the same way as those of hisopponent that is to say when his opponent placed a stone at anypoint he would place his stone on a point symmetrically opposite andin that way he is said to have won 
in regard to this anecdote it maybe said that the chinese must have been very weak players or theywould speedily have found means of overcoming this method of defense 
we next hear that in the year a japanese named wakino became famousas a great devotee of the game 
he played continuously day and night and became so engrossed in the game that he forgot everything elseabsolutely 
in the next two centuries the knowledge of the game did not extendbeyond the court at kioto 
indeed it appears that it was forbidden toplay go anywhere else than at court 
at all events we are told that inthe period called otoku a d the prince of dewa whose namewas kiowara no mahira secretly introduced the game into the provinceof oshu and played there with his vassals 
from that time not only thenumber of the nobility who played the game increased rapidly but thecommon people as well began to take it up 
our frontispiece illustrates an incident which is said to have occurredabout this time in the city of kamakura 
a samurai named sato tadanobu who was a vassal of yoshitsune a brother of yoritomo the first shogunof japan was playing go in his house when he was suddenly attacked byhis enemies and he is depicted using the goban as a weapon wherewithto defend himself 
the print is by kuniyoshi and is one of a seriesthe title of which might be translated as our favorite hero series the go ban go ishi and go tsubo look precisely like those whichare at present in use but kuniyoshi probably represented the type inuse in his day and not in the time of yoritomo as it is pretty wellsettled that in the early times the board was smaller 
there is also a story which comes down from the kamakura period inregard to hojo yoshitoki 
he is said to have been playing go with aguest at the moment that news arrived of the uprising of wadayoshimori 
yoshitoki is said to have first finished the game in perfectcalmness before he thought of his measures for subduing the revolution 
this was in the first year of kempo or a d 
in the beginning of the thirteenth century we find that go was widelyknown in the samurai class and was played with zeal 
at that timeeverybody who went to war from the most famous general down to themeanest soldier played the game 
the board and stones were carriedwith them to the field of battle and as soon as the battle was over they were brought out and the friendly strife began 
many of the monksand poets of that period also had a taste for go and several of themare mentioned as celebrated go players 
all three of the great japanese generals nobunaga hideyoshi andiyeyasu were devotees of the game 
it is related that nobunaga came tokioto in the tenth year of ten sho a d and lived in the honnojitemple 
one night the celebrated go player sansha of whom morehereafter came and played with him until midnight 
sansha had scarcelytaken his departure when the uprising of akechi mitsuhide broke out 
in the periods genki ten sho until keicho and gen wa there were many celebrated playersamong the monks poets farmers and tradespeople 
they were called tothe courts of the daimios and to the halls of the nobles either inorder that the nobility might play with them or more frequently merelyto exhibit their skill at the game 
this custom existed up to the timeof the fall of the shogunate 
that the japanese could find pleasure in merely watching a game that isso abstract in its nature and so difficult to understand is evidence ofthe fact that they were then a highly cultivated people intellectually 
we find nothing like it in this country except in the narrowest chesscircles 
in the beginning of the seventeenth century go attained such a highdevelopment that there appeared a series of expert players who farsurpassed anything known before 
of these the most famous were honinbosansha hoin nakamura doseki hayashi rigen inouye inseki and yasuisantetsu 
sansha was the son of a merchant of kioto 
when he was nine years oldhe shaved his head named himself nikkai and became a buddhist monk inthe temple of shokokuji which was one of the principal temples of thenichi ren sect in kioto 
from his early life sansha was very skilful atthe game and upon giving up his profession as a monk he obtainedpermission to institute a school of go players and he then took thename of honinbo sansha 
he was on terms of familiar intercourse withnobunaga hideyoshi and iyeyasu often accompanied them on theirtravels and campaigns and was present at many of the battles of thattroublous epoch 
the school of go which honinbo opened however was merely a privateundertaking 
the first state institution in which go was taught wasfounded by hideyoshi in the period ten sho but it seems tohave had a short existence and the permanent institution which lasteduntil the fall of the shogunate was founded by the successor ofhideyoshi iyeyasu 
iyeyasu became shogun in the year and thefoundation of the go academy or go in as the japanese call it musthave occurred soon after he ascended the throne 
honinbo sansha whowas still the best go player in japan was named as the head of theinstitution 
the other most skilful masters were installed asprofessors with good salaries 
to honinbo sansha the director wasgiven tsubo of land a tsubo is as big as two japanese mats ortatami and is therefore six feet square and an annual revenue of koku of rice a koku is a little more than five bushels 
men of thebest intelligence could now dedicate themselves to the education ofstudents and the further development of the game freed from the caresof earning a livelihood 
in both respects the institute was eminentlysuccessful 
its graduates were much more skilful than the previousgeneration of go players living in the land 
they devoted themselvesentirely to the game and either found positions as players at thecourt of a daimio or traveled through the country like the poets andswordsmen of that period playing the game and giving instruction inits mysteries as they found opportunity 
if they came to a place whichpleased them they often let their years of wandering come to an endand remained there making their living as teachers of the game 
at the time of the founding of the academy besides honinbo thepreviously mentioned masters hayashi inouye and yasui wereinstalled as professors 
for some reason nakamura who is mentionedabove as one of the contemporaries of honinbo did not appear at theacademy 
each of the four masters above named founded his school ormethod of play independently of the others and the custom existed thateach teacher adopted his best pupil as a son and thus had a successorat his death so the teachers in the academy were always named honinbo inouye hayashi and yasui 
 lovers of japanese prints are alreadyfamiliar with this continued similarity of names 
the best players of the academy had to appear every year before theshogun and play for his amusement 
this ceremony was called go zengo which means playing the game in the august presence or o shirogo shiro meaning the honorable palace and the masters of thegame entered these contests with the same determination that wasdisplayed by the samurai on the field of battle 
an anecdote has come down to us from the reign of the third shogun tokugawa iyemitsu showing how highly the go masters regarded theirart 
at that time yasui sanchi was meijin which as we shall see ina moment meant the highest rank in the go world while honinbosanyetsu held the rank of jo zu which was almost as high but which according to the rules would entitle him to a handicap of one stonefrom his expert adversary and these two men being the best players were selected to play in the shogun s presence 
honinbo feelingconscious of his skill disdained to accept the handicap and met hisadversary on even terms 
the game was proceeding in the presence of thecourt nobles before the shogun had appeared and among the spectatorswas matsudaira higo no kami one of the most powerful noblemen of thatepoch 
yasui sanchi was a favorite of matsudaira and as he watched theplay he remarked audibly that honinbo would surely be defeated 
honinbosanyetsu heard the remark and pausing in his play he allowed thestone which he was about to place on the board to fall back into the go tsubo or wooden jar that holds the go stones gently covered the go tsubo and drawing himself up with great dignity said i amserving the shogun with the art of go and when we go masters enter acontest it is in the same spirit as warriors go upon the field ofbattle staking our life if necessary to decide the contest 
while weare doing this we do not allow interference or comments from any one no matter how high may be his rank 
although i am not the greatestmaster of the game i hold the degree of jo zu and therefore thereare few players in japan who are able to appreciate my plans tactics or strategy 
nevertheless the prince of higo has unwarrantedlyprophesied my defeat 
i do not understand why he has done this but ifsuch a comment were allowed to become a precedent and onlookers werepermitted to make whatever comments on the game they saw fit it wouldbe better that the custom of the o shiro go should cease havingsaid this he raised himself from his seat 
at this moment the courtofficers announced the coming of the shogun and the noblemen who hadassembled to see the contest surprised and confused by the turnaffairs had taken earnestly persuaded honinbo to reseat himself andcontinue the game 
this he obstinately refused to do and endeavored toleave the imperial chamber 
prince matsudaira taken aback scarcelyknew what to do 
however he kotowed to honinbo and profuselyapologizing besought the offended master to finish the contest 
honinbo sanyetsu was appeased and resumed his seat at the board andboth players aroused by the incident exerted every effort to achievevictory 
honinbo sanyetsu won whereupon the prince of higo was greatlyhumiliated 
since then the name of sanyetsu has always been revered asone of the greatest of the honinbo family 
in the degenerate days toward the end of the tokugawa dynasty the gozen go became a mere farce and the games were all played through andstudied out beforehand in order that the ceremony in court might notlast too long 
the custom was however maintained until the fall ofthe shogunate in 
honinbo sansha established at the time of the foundation of the academya method of classifying the players by giving them degrees which stillexists although no longer under the authority of the state 
when a manattained to a certain measure of skill in the game he received thetitle shodan or of the first degree 
the still stronger playerswere arranged as nidan sandan yodan etc or of the second third and fourth degrees 
the highest degree in the series was kudan or the ninth degree 
in order to attain the first degree or shodan the candidate must be an excellent player so good in factthat he could follow the game as a profession 
in other games such agraduated system of classifying players would be scarcely possible butamong good go players it is feasible because the better player almostinvariably wins even if he be but slightly superior 
if the differencein skill could not be equalized in some way the game would becometiresome as the weaker player would almost always be able to foreseehis defeat 
the stronger player therefore allows his adversary toplace enough stones on the board as a handicap to make the adversariesapproximately equal 
according to the rules of the academy if the difference between theskill of the players was only one degree the weaker player would beallowed the first move 
if the difference was two degrees the weakerplayer would be allowed to place a stone on the board and the strongerplayer would have the first move and so on in other words thedifference between each degree might be called half a stone 
thus aplayer of the fourth degree would allow a player of the first degree toplace two stones on the board as a handicap but would have the firstmove 
a player of the seventh degree would allow a player of the firstdegree three stones and a player of the ninth degree would allow aplayer of the first degree four stones 
four was the highest handicapallowed among the players holding degrees but as we shall see later among players of less skill greater handicaps are frequently given 
a player of the seventh degree also received the honorary title jozu or the higher hand 
those of the eighth rank were called kanshu or the half-way step and those of the ninth degree were called mei shu the clear bright hand or mei jin literally celebratedman it is related that this last appellation arose in the time ofnobunaga who was a spectator of a game played by honinbo sansha withsome contemporary and who expressed his admiration of the skill ofhoninbo by exclaiming mei jin which thus became the title applied toplayers of the highest skill 
since the institution of this method of classifying go players overthree hundred years ago there have been only nine players who haveattained the ninth degree and only fourteen players who have attainedthe eighth degree 
on the other hand there have been many more of theseventh and many more still of each of the lower degrees 
in atthe time korschelt wrote the article previously referred to there wasonly one player in japan holding the seventh degree and that was thecelebrated murase shuho 
at present there is one player who holds theninth degree 
his name is honinbo shuyei and he is the only player whohas attained the ninth degree during the period called the meiji orsince the fall of the shogunate forty years ago 
this arrangement of the players in degrees is unknown in china andkorea 
on the other hand it is in use in the ryukyu or loochooislands 
the japanese seem to have regarded the classification in degrees as anabsolute standard of measurement 
nevertheless it must necessarilyhave varied from time to time and in the course of centuries thestandard must gradually have risen 
players of high rank who are challenged by the improving players of thelower grades will instinctively desire to make it more difficult forthe new players to attain the higher degree because their own fame which is their highest possession depends upon the result of the game and assuming that all trial games could be conducted in an impartialand judicial spirit nevertheless all the players would become moreexpert from the hard practice even if their skill in relation to eachother remained the same 
thus a seventh degree player of to-day would be better in a yearalthough he still remained in the seventh degree and this constantraising of the standard must lead us to suppose that a player of theseventh degree now is quite equal or perhaps superior to an eighth orninth degree player of a hundred or two hundred years ago 
as anillustration of this increase in skill we only have to compare thestandard set in the ryukyu islands 
they also established theclassification in degrees soon after the foundation of the academy injapan and then the two institutions seem to have lost touch 
korscheltrelates that for the first time about the year a go player of thesecond degree from the satsuma province visited those islands and triedhis skill with their best players and found that he could easilydefeat the players there classified as of the fifth degree 
the position as head of the academy was much coveted by go players butit was generally held by the honinbo family 
one of the last incidentsin relation to the academy tells of an attempt on the part of inouyeinseki the eleventh of that line to obtain the headship of theacademy when honinbo jowa who was the twelfth honinbo retired 
insekiwas afraid he could not obtain the coveted position by a contest andtherefore strove to obtain it by intrigue from the shogun s officerintrusted with the business of the academy 
when jowa retired he wasnot unaware of the desires of inseki but it did not trouble him much as he felt confident that the fourteenth honinbo whose name was shuwa could successfully defend his title 
however at last matters came tosuch a point that jowa ordered shuwa to present a petition to theshogun requesting that the title be settled by contest but theshogun s officer who was in league with inseki returned the petition whereupon all of the honinbo house rose and insisted on their rights inaccordance with custom and precedent and at last their petition wasgranted 
it was fixed that the title was to be decided by ten games and the first game began at the residence of the shogun s officer inaba tango no kami on the th of november in the eleventh year oftempo about sixty-six years ago and it ended the same year on the th of december 
there was an adjournment of four days and on oneoccasion the contest lasted all night 
therefore in all it took ninedays and one night to finish the game 
it is unnecessary to say that both players put forth all their effortsin this life and death struggle and it is said that inseki sexcitement was so intense as to cause blood to gush from his mouth buthe finally lost by four stones and the other nine games were notplayed 
inseki however mortified by his defeat again challengedshuwa 
this game began on the th of may in the thirteenth year oftempo and lasted two days 
inseki again lost by six stones 
onnovember th of the same year a third contest took place between shuwaand inseki in the presence of the shogun in his palace at tokio 
insekiagain lost by four stones 
in all these contests inseki as thechallenger had the first move and he finally became convinced of hisinability to win from the scion of the honinbo family and abandonedhis life-long desire and it is related that thereupon the houses ofhoninbo and inouye became more friendly than ever 
in the first half of the nineteenth century go had a period of greatdevelopment 
this occurred according to the japanese calendar in theperiods called bun kwa bun sei and tempo 
the collection of specimen games of that time are to-dayregarded as models and the methods of play and of opening the gamethen in use are still studied although they have been somewhatsuperseded 
the best games were played by the honinbos dosaku and jowaand yasui sanchi 
on the fall of the shogunate in the year the go academy came to anend and with it the regulation of the game by the state 
a few yearslater the daimios were dispossessed and they did not feel anobligation as private individuals to retain the services of the goplayers who had been in attendance at their courts 
thereupon ensued asad time for the masters of the game who had theretofore for the mostpart lived by the practice of their art and to make things stillworse the japanese people lost their interest in go 
upon the openingof the country the people turned with enthusiasm to the foreigners 
foreign things were more prized than native things and among thethings of native origin the game of go was neglected 
about the year however a reaction set in interest in the oldnational game was revived and at the present day it is fostered withas much zeal as in the olden times 
most of the higher officials of the government and also the officersin the army and navy are skilled players 
the great daily newspapersof the capitals have a go department just as some of our periodicalshave a department devoted to chess and the game is very much played atthe hot springs and health resorts and clubs and teachers of the artare found in all of the larger cities 
go has always retained somethingof its early aristocratic character and in fact it is still regardedas necessary for a man of refinement to possess a certain skill at thegame 
during the recent russo-japanese war the strategy employed by thejapanese commanders certainly suggested the methods of play used in thegame of go 
whether this was an accidental resemblance or not i cannotsay 
at liao yang it seemed as if marshal oyama had got three of thenecessary stones advantageously placed but the russians escaped beforethe fourth could be moved into position 
at the final battle of mukdenthe enveloping strategy characteristic of the game was carried out withstill greater success 
at the present time the division into the four schools of honinbo inouye hayashi and yasui no longer exists and go players aredivided into the schools of honinbo and hoyensha 
this latter schoolwas established about the year by murase shuho to whom referencehas already been made 
the honinbo school is the successor of the old academy while the newschool has made one or two innovations one of the most fortunate beinga rule that no game shall last longer than twenty-four hours withoutinterruption 
the hoyensha school also recognized the degree inakashodan which means the first degree in the country and is allowedto a class of players who are regarded as entitled to the first degreein their native town but who are generally undeceived when they meetthe recognized shodan players of the metropolis 
while in japan go has attained such a high development largely throughthe help of the government as has been shown it seems to be decadentin its motherland of china 
the japanese players assure us that thereis no player in china equal to a japanese player of the first degree 
in korea also the game is played but the skill there attained is alsoimmensely below the japanese standard 
having now given an idea of the importance of the game in the eyes ofthe japanese and the length of time it has been played we willproceed to a description of the board and stones and then take up thedetails of the play 
iidescription of the board and stonesthe board or go ban as it is called in japanese is a solid block ofwood about seventeen and a half inches long sixteen inches broad andgenerally about four or five inches thick 
it has four detachable feetor legs so that as it stands on the floor it is about eight incheshigh 
the board and feet are always stained yellow 
the best boards in japan are made of a wood called kaya torreyanucifera a species of yew 
they are also made of a wood called icho or gingko salisburia adiantifolia and of hinoki thuya obtusa akind of cedar 
at all events they must be of hard wood and yet not sohard as to be unpleasant to the touch when the stone is placed on theboard and the wood must further have the quality of resonance becausethe japanese enjoy hearing the sound made by the stone as it is played and they always place it on the board with considerable force whenspace will permit 
the japanese expression for playing go to wit gowo utsu literally means to strike go referring to the impact ofthe stone 
in korea this feature is carried to such an extreme thatwires are stretched beneath the board so that as a stone is played adistinct musical sound is produced 
the best boards should of course be free from knots and the grain should run diagonally across them 
in the back of the board there is cut a square depression 
the purposeof this is probably to make the block more resonant although the oldjapanese stories say that this depression was put there originally toreceive the blood of the vanquished in case the excitement of the gameled to a sanguinary conflict 
the legs of the board are said to be shaped to resemble the fruit ofthe plant called kuchinashi or cape jessamine gardenia floribunda the name of which plant by accident also means without a mouth andthis is supposed to suggest to onlookers that they refrain from makingcomments on the game a suggestion which all chess players willappreciate 
on the board parallel with each edge are nineteen thin lacqueredblack lines 
these lines are about four one-hundredths of an inch wide 
it has been seen from the dimensions given that the board is notexactly square and the field therefore is a parallelogram the sidesof which are sixteen and a half and fifteen inches long respectively and the lines in one direction are a little bit farther apart than inthe other 
these lines by their crossing produce three hundred andsixty-one points of intersection including the corners and the pointsalong the edge of the field 
the stones are placed on these points of intersection and not in thespaces as the pieces are in chess or checkers 
these intersections arecalled me or moku in japanese which really means an eye inasmuch as the word as used in this connection is untranslatable ishall hereafter refer to these points of intersection by their japanesename 
on the board as shown in the diagram plate are nine littlecircles 
it is on these circles that the handicap stones when given areplaced 
they have no other function in the game but they are supposedalso to have some sort of symbolical meaning 
chamberlain states thatthese spots or seimoku are supposed to represent the chief celestialbodies and that the central one is called taikyoku that is theprimordial principle of the universe 
in the work of stewart culinreferred to in the preface it is stated that they correspond to thenine lights of heaven the sun moon and the seven stars of theconstellation tau ursa major 
indeed the whole arrangement of theboard is said to have some symbolical significance the number ofcrosses exclusive of the central one representing the three hundredand sixty degrees of latitude and the number of white and black stonescorresponding to the number of days of the year but nowadays thejapanese do not make much of a point of the astronomical significanceof the board or of the seimoku the stones or ishi with which the game is played are three hundredand sixty-one in number corresponding to the number of me or pointsof intersection on the board 
one hundred and eighty of these stonesare white and the remaining one hundred and eighty-one are black 
asthe weaker player has the black stones and the first move obviouslythe extra stone must be black 
in practice the entire number of stonesis never used as at the end of the game there are always vacant spaceson the board 
the japanese generally keep these stones in gracefullyshaped lacquered boxes or go tsubo the white stones are made of a kind of white shell they are highlypolished and are exceedingly pleasant to the touch 
the best come fromthe provinces of hitachi and mikawa 
the black are made of stone generally a kind of slate that comes from the nachi cataract in kishiu 
as they are used they become almost jet-black and they are alsopleasant to the touch but not so much so as the white 
a good set isquite dear and cannot be purchased under several yen 
the ideographformerly used for go ishi indicates that originally they were made ofwood and not of stone and the old chinese ideograph shows that inthat country they were wooden pieces painted black and white 
the useof polished shell for the white stones was first introduced in theashikaga period 
in form the stones are disk-shaped but not always exactly round andare convex on both surfaces so that they tremble slightly when placedon the board 
they are about three-quarters of an inch in diameter andabout one-eighth of an inch in thickness 
the white stones aregenerally a trifle larger than the black ones for some strange reasonthose of both colors are a little bit wider than they should be inorder to fit the board 
korschelt carefully measured the stones whichhe used and found that the black were seventeen-sixteenths of thedistance between the vertical lines on his board and abouteighteen-nineteenths of the distance between the horizontal lines while the white stones were thirteen-twelfths of the distance betweenthe vertical lines and thirty-six thirty-sevenths of the distancebetween the horizontal lines 
i found about the same relation of sizein the board and stones which i use 
the result of this is that the stones do not have quite room enough andlap over each other and when the board is very full they push eachother out of place 
to make matters still worse the japanese are notvery careful to put the stones exactly on the points of intersection but place them carelessly so that the board has an irregularappearance 
it is probable that the unsymmetrical shape of the boardand the irregularity of the size of the stones arise from the antipathythat the japanese have to exact symmetry 
at any rate it is allcalculated to break up the monotonous appearance which the board wouldhave if the spaces were exactly square and the stones were exactlyround and fitted properly in their places 
in japan the board is placed on the floor and the players sit on thefloor also facing each other as shown in the illustration andgenerally the narrower side of the board is placed so as to face theplayers 
since the introduction of tables in japan go boards are alsomade thinner and without feet but the game seems to lose some of itscharm when the customs of the old japan are departed from 
the japanese always take the stone between the middle and indexfingers and not between the thumb and index finger as we are likely todo and they place it on the board smartly and with great skill sothat it gives a cheerful sound as before stated 
for use in this country the board need not be so thick and need not of course have feet but if it is attempted to play the game oncardboard which has a dead sound as the stones are played it issurprising how much the pleasure of the game is diminished 
the authorhas found that casino chips are the best substitute for the japanesestones 
originally the board used for the game of go was not so large and theintersecting lines in each direction were only seventeen in number 
atthe time of the foundation of the go academy this was the size of boardin use 
as the game developed the present number of lines became fixedafter trial and comparison with other possible sizes 
korschelt madecertain experiments with the next possible larger size in which thenumber of lines in each direction was twenty-one and it seemed thatthe game could still be played although it made necessary theintellect of a past master to grasp the resulting combinations 
if morethan twenty-one lines are used korschelt states that the combinationsare beyond the reach of the human mind 
in closing the description of the board it may be interesting to pointout that the game which we call go bang or five in a row is playedon what is really a japanese go board and the word go bang is merelyanother phonetic imitation of the words by which the japanese designatetheir board 
i have found however that the go bang boards sold inthe stores in this country are an imitation of the original japanese go ban and have only seventeen lines and are therefore a little toosmall for the game as now played 
the game which we call go bang alsooriginated in japan and is well known and still played there 
theycall it go moku narabe which means to arrange five me the word go in this case meaning five and moku being the alternative wayof pronouncing the ideograph for eye 
 go moku narabe is often playedby good go players generally for relaxation as it is a vastly simplergame than go and can be finished much more rapidly 
it is not however to be despised as when played by good players there isconsiderable chance for analysis and the play often covers the entireboard 
iiirules of playthe players play alternately and the weaker player has the blackstones and plays first unless a handicap has been given in which casethe player using the white stones has the first move 
 in the oldentimes this was just reversed 
they place the stones on the vacantpoints of intersection on the board or me and they may place themwherever they please with the single exception of the case called ko which will be hereafter explained 
when the stones are onceplayed they are never moved again 
the object of the game of go is to secure territory 
just as the objectof the game of chess is not to capture pieces but to checkmate theadverse king so in go the ultimate object is not to capture theadversary s stones but to so arrange matters that at the end of thegame a player s stones will surround as much vacant space as possible 
at the end of the game however before the amount of vacant space iscalculated the stones that have been taken are used to fill up thevacant spaces claimed by the adversary that is to say the capturedblack stones are used to fill up the spaces surrounded by the playerhaving the white pieces and vice versa and the player who has thegreatest amount of territory after the captured stones are used in thisway is the winner of the game 
however if the players fearing eachother merely fence in parts of the board without regard to eachother s play a most uninteresting game results and the japanese callthis by the contemptuous epithet ji dori go or ground taking go ihave noticed that beginners in this country sometimes start to play inthis way and it is one of the many ways by which the play of a merenovice may be recognized 
the best games arise when the players intheir efforts to secure territory attack each other s stones or groupsof stones and we therefore must know how a stone can be taken 
a stone is taken when it is surrounded on four opposite sides as shownin plate diagram i 
when it is taken it is removed from the board 
it is not necessary that a stone should also be surrounded diagonally which would make eight stones necessary in order to take one neitherdo four stones placed on the adjacent diagonal intersections cause astone to be taken they do not directly attack the stone in the centerat all 
plate diagram iv shows this situation 
a stone which is placed on the edge of the board may be surrounded andcaptured by three stones as shown in plate diagram ii and if astone is placed in the extreme corner of the board it may besurrounded and taken by two stones as shown in plate diagram iii 
in actual practice it seldom or never happens that a stone or group ofstones is surrounded by the minimum number requisite under the rule for in that case the player whose stones were threatened couldgenerally manage to break through his adversary s line 
it is almostalways necessary to add helping stones to those that are strictlynecessary in completing the capture 
plate diagram v shows fourstones which are surrounded with the minimum number of stones 
plate diagram vi shows the same group with a couple of helping stones added which would probably be found necessary in actual play 
it follows from this rule that stones which are on the same lineparallel with the edges of the board are connected and support eachother plate diagram vii while stones which are on the samediagonal line are not connected and do not support each other plate diagram viii 
in order to surround stones which are on the sameline and therefore connected it is necessary to surround them all inorder to take them while stones which are arranged on a diagonal line and therefore unconnected may be taken one at a time 
on plate diagram iii if there were a stone placed at s it would not beconnected with the stone in the corner and would not help it in anyway 
on the other hand as has been said it is not necessary to placea white stone on that point in order to complete the capture of thestone in the corner 
in order to capture a group or chain of stones containing vacant space it must be completely surrounded inside and out for instance theblack group shown on plate diagram ix while it has no hope of lifeif it is white s play is nevertheless not completely surrounded 
inorder to surround it it is necessary to play on the three vacantintersections at m n and o 
the same group of stones isshown in diagram x completely surrounded 
 it may be said in passingthat white must play at n first or the black stones can defendthemselves we shall understand this better in a moment 
in practice it often happens that a stone or group of stones isregarded as dead before it is completely surrounded because when thesituation is observed to be hopeless the losing player abandons it andaddresses his energies to some other part of the board 
it isadvantageous for the losing player to abandon such a group as soon aspossible for if he continues to add to the group he loses not onlythe territory but the added stones also 
if the circumstances are suchthat his opponent has to reply to his moves in the hopeless territory the loss is not so great as the opponent is meanwhile filling upspaces which would otherwise be vacant and against an inferior playerthere is a chance of the adversary making a slip and allowing thethreatened stones to save themselves 
if however the situation is soclearly hopeless that the adversary is not replying move for move thenevery stone added to such a group means a loss of two points 
at the end of the game such abandoned groups of stones are removed fromthe board just as if they had been completely surrounded and killed and it is not necessary for the player having the advantage actually tosurround and kill such a group 
it is enough if they obviously can bekilled 
the theory on which this rule proceeds is that if the playersplay alternately no advantage would be gained by either side in theprocess of actually surrounding such a group and its completion wouldonly be a waste of time 
but let us suppose that a black group at theend of the game is found to be hopeless and also completely surroundedwith the exception of one point 
the question arises can the blackplayer demand that his adversary play on the vacant space in order tokill this group for if he could it is obvious he would gain one me by so doing 
the answer is he cannot so demand and his adversary isnot bound to play on this point and the hopeless or abandoned stonesare removed without further play 
we might call such groups dead they may be distinguished from stones that are taken because theselatter are removed at once whereas dead stones are removed only atthe end of the game 
as a corollary to the rule for surrounding and taking stones itfollows that a group of stones containing two disconnected vacantintersections or me cannot be taken 
this is not a separate rule 
itfollows necessarily from the method by which stones are taken 
nevertheless in practice it is the most important principle in thegame 
in order to understand the rule or principle of the two me we mustfirst look at the situation shown in plate diagram i 
there if ablack stone is played at f although it is played on an intersectionentirely surrounded by white stones it nevertheless lives because themoment it is played it has the effect of killing the entire whitegroup that is to say a stone may be played on an intersection whereit is completely surrounded if as it is played it has the effect ofcompletely surrounding the adversary s stones already on the board 
if on the other hand we have a situation as shown in plate diagram ii a black stone may indeed be played on one of the vacant intersections but when it is so played the white group is not completely surrounded because there still remains one space yet to be filled and the blackstone itself is dead as soon as it touches the board and hence itwould be impossible to surround this group of white stones unless twostones were played at once 
the white stones therefore can never besurrounded and form an impregnable position 
this is the principle of the two me and when a player s group ofstones is hard pressed and his adversary is trying to surround them if he can so place the stones that two disconnected complete me areleft they are safe forever 
it makes no difference whether the vacant me are on the edges or in the corners of the board or how far fromeach other they may be 
plate diagram vi shows a group of stones containing two vacant me on the edge of the board 
this group is perfectly safe against attack 
a beginner might ask why the white group shown on plate diagram v is not safe 
the difficulty with that group is that when black hasplayed at s there are no me in it at all as the word is used inthis connection not even a kageme as shown in plate diagram iii because a me in order to be available for the purpose of defense must be a vacant intersection that is surrounded on four sides just asa captured stone must be surrounded and therefore on the sides of theboard it can be made by three stones and in the corner of the board bytwo stones but it is absolutely necessary in addition to the minimumnumber of surrounding stones to have helping stones to guard thesurrounding stones against attack 
this brings us to what the japanesecall kageme in actual play there are many groups of stones that at first glanceseem to have two vacant me in them but which on analysis will befound vulnerable to attack 
a me that looks somewhat as if it werecomplete but is nevertheless destructible is called kageme kage means chipped or incomplete plate diagram iii is anillustration of this 
a beginner might think that the white group wassafe but black can kill the upper six white stones by playing at e and then on the next move can kill the remainder by playing at g 
therefore e is not a perfect me but is kageme g is a perfect me but one is not enough to save the group 
in this group if thestone at f or d were white there would be two perfect me andthe group would be safe 
in a close game beginners often find itdifficult to distinguish between a perfect me and kageme groups of stones which contain vacant spaces can be lost or savedaccording as two disconnected me can or cannot be formed in thosespaces and the most interesting play in the game occurs along thesides and especially in the corners of the board in attempting to formor attempting to prevent the formation of these me the attackingplayer often plays into the vacant space and sacrifices several stoneswith the ultimate object of reducing the space to one me and on theother hand the defending player by selecting a fortunate intersectionmay make it impossible for the stones to be killed 
there isopportunity for marvelous ingenuity in the attack and defense of thesepositions 
a simple example of defense is shown in plate diagram iv where if it is white s turn and he plays in the corner of the boardat t he can save his stones 
if on the other hand he playsanywhere else the two me can never be formed 
the beginner would dowell to work out this situation for himself 
the series of diagrams commencing at plate diagram v show thetheoretical method of reducing vacant spaces by the sacrifice ofstones 
this series is taken from korschelt and the position as itarose in actual play is shown on plate depicting a complete game 
in plate diagram v the white group is shown externally surrounded and the black stone has just been played at s rendering the grouphopeless 
the same group is shown on the opposite side of the board atplate diagram i but black has added three more stones and couldkill the white group on the next move 
therefore white plays at a and the situation shown in plate diagram ii arises where the samegroup is shown on the lower edge of the board 
now if it were white smove he could save his group by playing at j and the situationwhich would then arise is shown on plate diagram iii where whitehas three perfect me one more than enough 
however it is notwhite s move and black plays on the coveted intersection and thenadds two more stones until the situation shown in plate diagram iv arises 
then white must again play at s in order to save his stonesfrom immediate capture and the situation shown at plate diagram i comes about 
black again plays at j adds one more stone and wehave the situation shown in plate diagram ii where it is obviousthat white must play at c in order to save his group from immediatecapture thus leaving only two vacant spaces 
it is unnecessary tocontinue the analysis further but at the risk of explaining what isapparent it might be pointed out that black would play on one of thesevacant spaces and if white killed the stone which it would not paywhite to do black would play again on the space thus made vacant andcompletely surround and kill the entire white group 
a group with five vacant me as shown in the preceding diagrams is asituation well known to the japanese so much so that they have aspecial phrase or saying that applies to it to wit go moku naka dewa ju san te which means that it takes thirteen turns to reduce agroup having five such me in the center 
as we have previously seen in actual play this white group would beregarded as dead as distinguished from taken and this series ofmoves would not be played out 
white obviously would not play in thespace and he could not demand that black play therein in order tocomplete the actual surrounding of the stones and the only purpose ofgiving this series of diagrams is to show theoretically how the whitestones can be killed 
however the killing of these stones would benecessary if the surrounding black line were in turn attacked semeai in which case it might be a race to see whether theinternal white stones could be completely surrounded and killed beforethe external white group could get in complete contact with the blackline 
stones which are sacrificed in order to kill a larger group are called sute ishi by the japanese from suteru meaning to cast or throwaway and ishi a stone it may be noted that if a group contains four connected vacantintersections in a line it is safe because if the adversary attemptsto reduce it two disconnected me can be formed in the space bysimply playing a stone adjacent to the adversary s stone as shown inplate diagram iii where if black plays for instance at k whitereplies at l and secures the two me even if these four connectedvacant intersections are not in a straight line they are neverthelesssufficient for the purpose provided the fourth me is connected atthe end of the three and the japanese express this by their saying magari shimoku wa me or four me turning a corner 
neither does itmake any difference whether the four connected me are in the centerof the board or along the edge 
on plate diagrams iv and v areexamples of magari shimoku wa me and they both are safe 
it isinteresting however to compare these situations with that shown atplate diagram ii where the fourth intersection is not connected atthe end of the line and which group black can kill if it is his move as we already have seen 
if however such a group contains only three connected vacantintersections and it is the adversary s move it can be killed because the adversary by playing on the middle intersection can preventthe formation of two disconnected me we saw a group of this kind onplate diagram ix which can be killed by playing at n 
obviously if it is black s move in this case the group can be saved by playingat n obviously also if white being a mere novice playselsewhere than at n black saves the stones by playing there andkilling the white stone 
plate diagram vi shows another groupcontaining only three vacant intersections 
these can be killed if itis black s move by playing at a 
on the other hand if it is white smove he can save them by playing on the same point 
of course if a group of stones contains a large number of vacantintersections it is perfectly safe unless the vacant space is so largethat the adversary can have a chance of forming an entire new livinggroup of stones therein 
we now come to the one exception to the rule that the players may placetheir stones at will on any vacant intersection on the board 
this ruleis called the rule of ko and is shown on plate diagram i 
assuming that it is white s turn to play he can play at d and takethe black stone at c which is already surrounded on three sides andthe position shown in plate diagram ii would then arise 
it is nowwhite s turn to play and if he plays at c the white stone whichhas just been put down will be likewise surrounded and could be at oncetaken from the board 
black however is not permitted to do thisimmediately but must first play somewhere else and this gives whitethe choice of filling up this space c and defending his stone orof following his adversary to some other portion of the board 
thereason for this rule in regard to ko is very clear 
if the playerswere permitted to take and retake the stones as shown in the diagram the series of moves would be endless and the game could never befinished 
it is something like perpetual check in chess but thejapanese in place of calling the game a draw compel the second playerto move elsewhere and thus allow the game to continue 
in an actualgame when a player is prevented from retaking a stone by the rule of ko he always tries to play in some other portion of the board wherehe threatens a larger group of stones than is involved in the situationwhere ko occurs and thus often he can compel his adversary to followhim to this other part of the field and then return to retake in ko his adversary then will play in some part of the field if possible where another group can be threatened and so on 
sometimes in a hotlycontested game the battle will rage around a place where ko occursand the space will be taken and retaken several times 
korschelt states that the ideograph for ko means talent or skilfulness in which he is very likely wrong as it is moreaccurately translated by our word threat but be this as it may itis certainly true that the rule in regard to ko gives opportunity fora great display of skill and as the better players take advantage ofthis rule with much greater ingenuity it is a good idea for the weakerplayer as far as possible to avoid situations where its applicationarises 
there is a situation which sometimes arises and which might be mistakenfor ko it is where a player takes more than one stone and theattacking stone is threatened on three sides or where only one stoneis taken but the adversary in replying can take not only the laststone played but others also 
in these cases the opponent can retakeimmediately because it will at once be seen that an endless exchangeof moves which makes necessary the rule of ko would not occur 
asituation of this kind is shown on plate diagrams iii iv and v where white by playing at c diagram iii takes the three blackstones producing the situation shown in diagram iv and black ispermitted immediately to retake the white stone producing the state ofaffairs shown in diagram v the japanese call such a situation utekaeshi which means returning a blow it forms no exception to theordinary rules of the game and only needs to be pointed out because abeginner might think that the rule of ko applied to it 
we will now take up the situation called seki seki means a barrier or impasse it is a different word from the seki in thephrase jo seki seki also is somewhat analogous to perpetual check 
it arises when a vacant space is surrounded partly by white and partlyby black stones in such a way that if either player places a stonetherein his adversary can thereupon capture the entire group 
underthese circumstances of course neither player desires to place a stoneon that portion of the board and the rules of the game do not compelhim to do so 
that portion of the board is regarded as neutralterritory and at the end of the game the vacant me are not countedin favor of either player 
plate diagram vi gives an illustrationof seki where it will be seen that if black plays at either s ort white can kill the black stones in the corner by playing on theother point and if white plays on either point black can kill thewhite stones by filling the remaining vacancy 
directly below ondiagram vii is shown the same group but the corner black stone hasbeen taken out 
the position is now no longer seki but is called bythe japanese me ari me nashi or literally having me not having me here the white stones are dead because if black plays forinstance at t white cannot kill the black stones by playing at s for the reason that the vacant me at t still remains 
the beginnermight confuse seki with me ari me nashi and while a good playerhas no trouble in recognizing the difference when the situation arises it takes considerable foresight sometimes so to play as to produce onesituation or the other 
plate diagram viii shows another group which might be mistaken for seki but here if white plays at j the black stones can bekilled further proceedings being somewhat similar to those we saw inthe illustration of go moku naka de wa ju san te plate shows alarge group of stones from which inevitably seki will result 
itwould be well for the student to work this out for himself 
 seki veryseldom or never occurs in games between good players and it rarelyoccurs in any game 
it is a rule of the game to give warning when a stone or group ofstones is about to be completely surrounded 
for this purpose thejapanese use the word atari from ataru to touch lightly whichcorresponds quite closely to the expression gardez in chess 
if thiswarning were omitted the player whose stones were about to be takenshould have the right to take his last move over and save the imperiledposition if he could 
this rule is not so strictly observed asformerly it belongs more to the etiquette of the old japan 
the game comes to an end when the frontiers of the opposing groups arein contact 
this does not mean that the board is entirely covered forthe obvious reason that the space inside the groups or chains of stonesis purposely left vacant for that is the only part of the board whichcounts but so long as there is any vacant space lying between theopposing groups that must be disposed of in some way and when it is sodisposed of it will be found that the white and black groups are incomplete contact 
just at the end of the game there will be found isolated vacantintersections or me on the frontier lines and it does not make anydifference which player fills these up 
they are called by the japanese dame which means useless the word dame is likely to beconfusing when it is first heard because the beginner jumps to theconclusion that it is some new kind of a me this arises from acoincidence only 
anything that is useless or profitless is called dame in japanese but etymologically the word really means horse seye as the japanese not being admirers of the vacant stare of thatnoble animal have used this word as a synonym for all that is useless 
therefore the syllable me does mean an eye and is the same word thatis used to designate the intersections but its recurrence in thisconnection is merely an accident 
it is difficult for the beginner at first to understand why the fillingof these dame results in no advantage to either player and beginnersoften fill up such spaces even before the end of the game feeling thatthey are gaining ground slowly but surely and the japanese have asaying heta go ni dame nashi which means that there are no dame in beginners go as beginners do not recognize their uselessness 
onthe other hand a necessary move will sometimes look like dame themoves that are likely to be so confused are the final connecting movesor tsugu where a potential connection has been made early in thegame but which need to be filled up to complete the chain 
in theillustrative game number i the dame are all given but a littlepractice is necessary before they can always be recognized 
when the dame have been filled and the dead stones have been removedfrom the board there is no reason why the players should not at onceproceed to counting up which of them has the greatest amount of vacantspace less of course the number of stones they have lost and thusdetermine who is the victor 
as a matter of practice however thejapanese do not do this immediately but purely for the purpose offacilitating the count the player having the white pieces would fillup his adversary s territory with the black stones he had captured asfar as they would go and the player having the black stones would fillup his adversary s territory with the white stones that he hadcaptured and thereupon the entire board is reconstructed so that thevacant spaces come into rows of fives and tens so that they are easierto count 
this has really nothing to do with the game and it is merelya device to make the counting of the spaces easier but it seems like amysterious process to a novice and adds not a little to the generalmystery with which the end of the game seems to be surrounded when anoccidental sees it played for the first time 
this process ofarrangement is called me wo tsukuru it may be added that if any partof the board contains the situation called seki that portion is leftalone and is not reconstructed like the rest of the board 
plate shows a completed game in which the dame have all beenfilled but the dead stones have not yet been removed from the board 
let us first see which of the stones are dead 
it is easy to see thatthe white stone at n is hopeless as it is cut off in everydirection 
the same is true of the white stone at b 
it is not soeasy to see that the black stones at l and m n o p q and r n and m and n are dead but against a good player they would haveno hope of forming the necessary two me and they are thereforeconceded to be dead but a good player could probably manage to defendthem against a novice 
it is still more difficult to see why theirregular white group of eighteen stones on the left-hand side of theboard has been abandoned but there also white has no chance of makingthe necessary two me at the risk of repetition i will again pointout that these groups of dead stones can be taken from the boardwithout further play 
plate shows the same game after the dead stones have been removed andused to fill up the respective territories and after the board hasbeen reconstructed in accordance with the japanese method and it willbe seen that in this case black has won by one stone 
this result canbe arrived at equally well by counting up the spaces on plate butthey are easier to count on plate after the me wo tsukuru has beendone 
plate shows another completed game 
this plate is from korschelt and is interesting because it contains an instructive error 
the gameis supposed to be completed and the black stone at c is said to bedead 
this is not true because black by playing at c could not onlysave his stone but kill the four white stones at the left-hand side 
therefore before this game is completed white must play at c todefend himself 
this is called tsugu on the left-hand side of theboard is shown a white group which is dead and the method of reductionof which we have already studied in detail 
on the right side of theboard are a few scattering black stones which are dead because theyhave no chance of forming a group with the necessary two me thequestion may be asked whether it is necessary for white to play at c or e in order to complete the connection of the group in the corner but he is not obliged so to do unless black chooses to play at b or f which of course black would not do 
on plate this game also is shown as reconstructed for counting andit will be seen that white has won by two stones 
really this is anerror of one stone as white should have played at c as we havepreviously pointed out 
sometimes at the end of the game players of moderate skill may differas to whether there is anything left to be done and when one thinksthere is no longer any advantage to be gained by either side he says  mo arimasen aru naraba o yuki nasai that is to say i think thereis nothing more to be done if you think you can gain anything you mayplay and sometimes he will allow his adversary to play two or threetimes in succession reserving the right to step in if he thinks thereis a chance of his adversary reviving a group that is apparently dead 
no part of the rules of the game has been more difficult for me tounderstand than the methods employed at the end and especially therule in regard to the removal of dead stones without actuallysurrounding them but i trust in the foregoing examples i have madethis rule sufficiently clear 
moreover it is not always easy to tellwhether stones are dead or alive 
there is a little poem or hokku injapanese which runs as follows  iki shini wo shiranu nonki no go uchi kana which might be translated as oh 
what kind of a go player is he whodoes not know whether his stones are alive or dead but while thejapanese author of this hokku may have regarded it as a simple thing the occidental student of the game would not be likely to share hisviews 
an instance of this is shown by the possibilities of thesupposedly dead black stone on plate and i think it would be fairerto state that the skill of a good go player is most clearly shown byhis ability to recognize immediately whether a group is dead or can besaved the study of our chapter on problems will give furtherillustrations of the difficulty and nicety of such decisions 
we now come to the question of handicaps 
handicaps are given by thestronger player allowing the weaker player to place a certain number ofstones on the board before the game begins and we have seen in thechapter on the description of the board that these stones are placed onthe nine dotted intersections 
if one stone is given it is usual toplace it in the upper right-hand corner 
if a second stone is given itis placed in the lower left-hand corner 
if a third stone is given itis placed in the lower right-hand corner 
the fourth is placed in theupper left-hand corner 
the fifth is placed at the center or ten gen when six are given the center one is removed and the fifth and sixthare placed at the left and right-hand edges of the board on line 
ifseven are given these stones remain and the seventh stone is placedin the center 
if eight are given the center stone is again removed and the seventh and eighth stones are placed on the seimoku on linek if the ninth is given it is again placed in the center of theboard 
between players of reasonable skill more than nine stones are nevergiven but when the disparity between the players is too great fourother stones are sometimes given 
they are placed just outside thecorner seimoku as shown on the diagram plate and these extrastones are called furin handicaps 
 furin means a small bell asthese stones suggest to the japanese the bells which hang from theeaves at the corners of a japanese temple 
when the disparity betweenthe players is very great indeed sometimes four more stones are given and when given they are placed on the diagonal halfway between thecorner seimoku and the center 
these four stones are called nakayotsu or the four middle stones but such a handicap could only begiven to the merest novice 
we have now completed a survey of all the actual rules of the game andit may be well to summarize them in order that their real simplicitymay be clearly seen briefly they are as follows  
the object of the game is to obtain vacant territory 
 
the stones are placed on the intersections and on any vacantintersection the player chooses except in the case of ko 
afterthey are played they are not moved again 
 
 a one or more stones which are compactly surrounded by the stonesof the other side are said to be taken and are at once removed from theboard 
 b stones which while not actually surrounded can inevitably besurrounded are dead and can be taken from the board at the end of thegame without further play 
 c taken or dead stones are used to fill up the adversary s territory 
 
the game is at an end when the opposing groups of stones are inabsolute contact the case of seki being the single exception 
it is not possible to imagine a game with simpler rules or theelements of which are easier to acquire 
we will now turn our attention to a few considerations as to the bestmethods of play and of certain moves and formations which occur inevery game and also to the names which in japanese are used todesignate these things 
ivgeneral methods of play and terminology of the gameas will be shown more in detail in the chapter on openings or joseki the game is commenced by playing in the corners of the board andgenerally on one of the squares adjacent to the handicap point 
thereason for this is that the corners of the board are naturalfortresses and can be more readily defended against attack 
it is alsoeasier to form territory in the corners of the board 
next to thecorners of the board the sides of the board are easiest to defend andterritory is more easily formed along the sides than in the center andin an ordinary game the play generally proceeds from the corners andedges to the center 
the importance which the japanese attach to thecorners is shown by their saying yo sumi torarete go wo utsu na or  if the four corners are taken cease playing against a good playerit is next to impossible to form territory in the center of the board unless it is based on one of the sides or corners 
there is however an old rule of etiquette which is not consistentwith this theory of the opening it used to be regarded as exceedinglyimpolite and insulting to play the first stone on the handicap point inthe center of the board called ten gen it has been explained to methat the reason for this rule is that such a move was supposed toassure the victory to the first player and it is related that when onone occasion murase shuho had defeated a rival many times insuccession the latter becoming desperate apologized for his rudenessand placed his stone on this spot and murase nevertheless succeededin winning the game which was regarded as evidence of his great skill 
it has however been shown by honinbo dosaku that this move gives thefirst player no decisive advantage and i have been also told by somejapanese that the reason that this move is regarded as impolite isbecause it is a wasted move and implies a disrespect for theadversary s skill and from what experience i have had in the game ithink the latter explanation is more plausible 
at all events such amove is most unusual and can only be utilized by a player of thehighest skill 
when good players commence the game from the first they have in mindthe entire board and they generally play a stone in each of the fourcorners and one or two around the edges of the board sketching out asit were the territory which they ultimately hope to obtain 
they donot at once attack each other s stones and it is not until the game iswell advanced that anything like a hand to hand conflict occurs 
beginners are likely to engage at once in a close conflict 
their mindsseem to be occupied with an intense desire to surround and capture thefirst stones the adversary places on the board and often theiropposing groups of stones starting in one corner will spread out in astruggling mass from that point all over the board 
there is no surerindication of the play of a novice than this 
it is just as if a battlewere to commence without the guidance of a commanding officer byindiscriminate fisticuffs among the common soldiers 
of the otherextreme or ji dori go we have already spoken 
another way in whichthe play of experts may be recognized is that all the stones of a goodplayer are likely to be connected in one or at most two groups whilepoorer players find their stones divided up into small groups each ofwhich has to struggle to form the necessary two me in order to insuresurvival 
assuming that we have advanced far enough to avoid premature encountersor ji dori go and are placing our stones in advantageous positions decently and in order the question arises how many spaces can besafely skipped from stone to stone in advancing our frontiers that isto say how far can stones be separated and yet be potentiallyconnected and therefore safe against attack 
the answer is that twospaces can safely be left if there are no adversary s stones in theimmediate vicinity 
to demonstrate this let us suppose that black hasstones at r and r and white tries to cut them off from eachother 
white s best line of attack would be as follows  white black r s  r s  q r  q r  q and black has made good his connection or black at his fourth movecould play at q then w b q r  p takes 
there are other continuations but they are still worse for white 
if however the adversary s stones are already posted on the line ofadvance sometimes it is only safe to skip one point and of course inclose positions the stones must be played so that they are actuallyconnected 
the japanese call this skipping of me by the terms ikkentobi nikken tobi sangen tobi etc which literally means tofly one two or three spaces although this is plain enough theserelations are nevertheless shown on plate diagrams i ii and iii 
when stones of opposite colors on the same line are separated by vacantspace in a similar way diagram iv then the terms ikken kakari  nikken kakari etc are used 
 kakari really means to hang or tobe related but as used in this sense it might be translated toattack sometimes the stones are placed in relation to each other like theknight s move in chess 
the knight in japanese is called keima or the honorable horse and if the stones are of the same color therelation is called keima or kogeima ko being the diminutive 
ifthe stones are of opposite colors then the phrase keima or kogeimakakari is used as in the previous case 
the japanese also designate arelation similar to the knight s move but farther apart by specialwords thus if the stones are one space farther apart it is called ogeima or the great knight s move and if the stone is advancedone step still farther it is called daidaigeima or the great greatknight s move on plate diagrams v vi and vii are shown kogeima ogeima and daidaigeima the next question that will trouble the beginner is where to place hisstones when his adversary is advancing into his territory andbeginners are likely to play their stones directly in contact with theadvancing forces 
this merely results in their being engulfed by theattacking line and the stones and territory are both lost 
if you wishto stop your adversary s advance play your stones a space or two apartfrom his so that you have a chance to strengthen your line before hisattack is upon you 
the next thing we will speak of is what the japanese call the sente this word means literally the leading hand but is best translated byour words having the offensive it corresponds quite closely to theword attack as it is used in chess but in describing a game of goit is better to reserve the word attack for a stronger demonstrationthan is indicated by the word sente the sente merely means thatthe player having it can compel his adversary to answer his moves orelse sustain worse damage and sometimes one player will have the sente in one portion of the board and his adversary may disregardthe attack and by playing in some other quarter take the sente there 
sometimes the defending player by his ingenious moves may turn thetables on his adversary and wrest the sente from him 
at all events holding the sente is an advantage and the annotations onillustrative games abound with references to it and conservativeauthors on the game advise abandoning a stone or two for the purpose oftaking the sente sometimes a player has three stones surrounding a vacant space asshown in plate diagram viii and the question arises how to attackthis group 
this is done by playing on the fourth intersection 
thejapanese call this nozoku or peeping into and when a stone isplayed in this way it generally forces the adversary to fill up that me it may be mentioned here also that when your adversary is tryingto form me in a disputed territory the way to circumvent him is toplay your stones on one of the four points he will obviously need tocomplete his me and sometimes this is done before he has three ofthe necessary stones on the board 
the term nozoku is also applied toany stone which is played as a preliminary move in cutting theconnection between two of the adversary s stones or groups of stones 
sometimes a situation occurs as shown in plate diagram ix 
here itis supposed to be white s move and he must of course play at k whereupon black would play at k osaeru and white would have toplay at l nobiru and so on until if these moves were persistedin the formation would stretch in a zigzag line to the edge of theboard 
this situation is called shicho which really means a runningattack it results in the capture of the white stones when the edge ofthe board is reached unless they happen to find a comrade posted onthe line of retreat for instance at p in which case they can besaved 
of course between good players shicho is never played out tothe end for they can at once see whether or not the stones will live and often a stone placed seemingly at random in a distant part of theboard is played partly with the object of supporting a retreating lineshould shicho occur 
plate diagram x shows a situation that often arises in which thewhite player by putting his stone at m on the edge of the board canjoin his two groups of stones 
this is so because if black plays at l or n white can immediately kill the stone 
this joining on the edgeof the board is called by the special term watari which means tocross over sometimes we find the word watari used when theconnection between two groups is made in a similar way although not atthe extreme edge of the board 
a much more frequent situation is shown at plate diagram xi 
it isnot worthy of special notice except because a special word is appliedto it 
if black plays at s it is called haneru which really meansthe flourish which is made in finishing an ideograph 
we will now take up a few of the other words that are used by thejapanese as they play the game 
by far the most frequent of these are tsugu kiru nobiru and osaeru tsugu means to connect and when two stones are adjacent but on the diagonal as shown in plate diagram xii it is necessary to connect them if an attack isthreatened 
this may be done by playing on either side that is to say at q or r 
if on the other hand black should play on both thesepoints the white stones would be forever separated and this cuttingoff is called kiru although as a rule when such a situation isworthy of comment one of the intersections has already been filled bythe attacking player 
plate diagram xiii illustrates kiru where if a black stone is played at q the white stones areseparated 
 kiru means to cut and is recognizable as one of thecomponent parts of that much abused and mispronounced word harakiri  nobiru means to extend and when there is a line of stones it meansthe adding of another one at the end not skipping a space as in thecase of ikken tobi but extending with the stones absolutelyconnected 
in plate diagram xiv if black plays at q it would becalled nobiru osaeru means to press down and this is what we dowhen we desire to prevent our adversary from extending his line asseen in the preceding diagram 
it is done by playing directly at theend of the adversary s line as shown in diagram xv where black issupposed to play at q 
here white must play on one side of the blackstone but it must be pointed out that unless there is support in theneighborhood for the stone used in osaeru the stone thus played runsthe risk of capture 
in diagram ix explaining shicho we also had anillustration of nobiru and osaeru if a stone is played on the intersection diagonally adjacent to anotherstone it is called kosumu but this word is not nearly so much usedas the other four 
sometimes also when it is necessary to connect twogroups of stones instead of placing the stone so as actually to connectthem as in the case of tsugu the stone is played so as toeffectively guard the point of connection and thus prevent theadversary s stone from separating the two groups 
this play is called kake tsugu or a hanging connection e g in diagram xiii if awhite stone were played at q it would be an instance of kake tsugu and would have prevented the black stone from cutting off the whiteconnection at q for if the black stone were played there after awhite stone had been placed at q white could capture it on the nextmove 
passing from these words which describe the commonest moves in thegame we will mention the expression te okure literally a slow hand or a slow move which means an unnecessary or wasted move 
many ofthe moves of a beginner are of this character especially when he has aterritory pretty well fenced in and cannot make up his mind whether ornot it is necessary to strengthen the group before proceeding toanother field of battle 
in annotating the best games also it is usedto mean a move that is not the best possible move and we frequentlyhear it used by japanese in criticising the play 
 semeai is another word with which we must be familiar 
it means mutually attacking from semeru to attack and au toencounter that is to say if the white player attacks a group ofblack stones the black player answers by endeavoring to surround thesurrounding stones and so on 
in our illustrative game number i theplay in the upper right-hand corner of the board is an example of semeai it is in positions of this kind that the condition of affairscalled seki often comes about 
plate diagram xvi shows a position which is illustrated onlybecause a special name is applied to it 
the japanese call such arelation of stones cho tsugai literally the hinge of a door the last expression which we will give is naka oshi gatchi which isthe term applied to a victory by a large margin in the early part ofthe game 
these japanese words mean to conquer by pushing the center beginners are generally desirous of achieving a victory in this way and are not content to allow their adversary any portion of the board 
it is one of the first things to be remembered that no matter howskilful a player may be his adversary will always be able to acquiresome territory and one of the maxims of the game is not to attempt toachieve too great a victory 
before proceeding with the technical chapters on the illustrativegames openings etc it may be well to say a word in regard to themethod adopted for keeping a record of the game 
the japanese do thisby simply showing a picture of the finished game on which each stoneis numbered as it was played 
if a stone is taken and another stone isput in its place an annotation is made over the diagram of the boardwith a reference to that intersection stating that such a stone hasbeen taken in ko such a method with the necessary marginalannotation is good enough but it is very hard to follow as there isno means of telling where any stone is without searching all over theboard for it and while the japanese are very clever at this occidental students of the game do not find it so easy 
therefore ihave adopted the method suggested by korschelt which in turn isfounded on the custom of chess annotation in use all over the world 
the lines at the bottom of the board are lettered from a to t theletter i being omitted and at the sides of the board they are numberedup from to 
thus it is always easy to locate any given stone 
inthe last few years the japanese have commenced to adopt an analogousmethod of notation

the frontiers are now absolutely in contact and the count can be made and it will be seen that after filling up the vacant territory with thecaptured stones as far as they will go black has won by three points 
the japanese would rearrange the board in order to make the counting ofthe spaces more easy me wo tsukuru but for the first game or twothe beginner might find it less confusing to omit this process 
honinbo shuye comments on this game as follows  in spite of so many errors black wins showing how great is theadvantage resulting from a handicap iiplate white murase shuho seventh degree 
black uchigaki sutekichi fifth degree 
this game is taken from korschelt and the notes are his 
in some ofthese notes will be found mere repetitions of matter that i haveinserted in the preceding chapters or which will be hereafter found inthe chapter on joseki these notes are however very full andvaluable and a little repetition may have the effect of aiding thememory of the student and will do no harm 
contrary to the custom this game was played without handicaps 
black white 
r 
in the beginning of 
d  the game the corners and margins are first occupied because it is there that positions can most easily be taken which cannot be killed and which also contain territory 
from the edges and corners the player makes toward the center 
this process is repeated in every game 
 
q 
in taking a corner 
p 
the attack could that is still vacant there also be commenced at p  is a choice among seven points e g in the corner designated as d  these points are d d  d c c e and e 
on the other hand c  and e are bad because the territory which is obtained by c is too small and the adversary would reply to e with d by means of which e  would be cut off from the margin 
of moves that are good d -c are the surest and most frequently used 
e -d  formerly were the favorite moves but the preceding moves are now preferred to them 
e -c are seldom used 
all of this of course applies to the corresponding points in the other three corners 
 
c 
 
q 
corresponding to no 
 this move should have been played at r or q  but white plays on q  because if he played on q black would have replied at r or r  and later white p and black o would have followed with the result that white has nothing  while black has obtained two positions one on o-q and the other on r  
o 
beginners would have 
d 
the position d d replied to q with q or is very strong and r 
they attack their players like to take it 
opponent at close quarters this applies of course  from the beginning to the corresponding because they cannot take positions in other parts in the whole field at a of the board of which glance 
their entire there are seven i e c effort is to absorb the e q q etc 
as last stone that their soon as one player gets a opponent has played 
when position of the kind his two beginners play opponent often takes a together the battle moves similar position on the slowly from a corner out next move in order to over the board and one balance the advantage side of the board is gained by his adversary  entirely filled with this is something like stones while the other is castling in chess 
completely empty 
this is a sure sign of bad play 
in the beginning the good players spread their stones over the board as much as possible and avoid close conflicts

c w e  and black has the advantage because white s stones at c -e can only get one me on the edge of the board and later on must seek a connection with some other group 
by constantly harassing such endangered groups territory is often obtained 
 
r 
in place of taking 
c 
white sees that black this secure position on plays too carefully and line r black should have therefore challenges him attacked the white stone with a bold but premature on p with l and in attack that gives the this way black would have whole game its character

as soon as black answers this move white will take territory on the right or left of h 
 
g 
is played very 
m 
two stones which carefully 
k would mutually support each probably have been better 
other on the margin of the in that case white would board and form a position either have played h in cannot be separated by order to save h more than two spaces for whereupon instance r r 
in that case the adversary b f w e cannot cut one off from b k the other 
 korschelt here inserts continuations would have followed or similar to what we have white would have answered shown in a preceding at k 
chapter 
therefore  white s twentieth and twenty-second moves are merely intended to fill territory that would otherwise fall to black  and are not intended to form a new group 
 
h 
the only correct 
m 
white seeks to form a answer would have been k connection with no 
  which would have which black frustrates by separated white s his twenty-fifth move 
it twentieth and is of the greatest twenty-second stones 
importance to prevent the union of groups which the adversary has formed on the margin in order that they may remain weak and require continuous defense 
the player who has the sente most of the time will generally be the victor 
 
o 
 
q 
is very necessary in order not to surrender the entire right side to black 
 
k 
all good players 
h 
this move has the agree that should not effect of abandoning stone have been played at k no 
 at p 
after but at l 
this is black s twenty-ninth move difficult to understand at n no 
 could still because k can be escape by means of p  supported from both sides but giving it up brings at g and n but l more territory elsewhere is better because black than is there lost 
it is should be occupied not a favorite device of merely with taking a strong players to position but more apparently abandon a particularly with killing position to their white s fourth stone 
in adversary after first the sequel k is preparing it so that actually taken by white 
eventually it may live or so that it may afterward aid in surrounding one of the adversary s groups 
the abandoned position often reawakens to life if the weaker adversary allows his surrounding group to be itself surrounded and taken before the capture of the abandoned position has been completed

g 
 
k 
it might have been better to have played at g 
then if black replied at h white could play at c and the white territory in the neighborhood of line d would be very large 
certainly in that case h  would have been abandoned  but not m -m 
since  k is purely defensive  black gets the attack and appreciably reduces the white territory in the neighborhood of line d

if this move had not divided the black groups  black would have become too powerful

this connects the two parts of the white position which connection was threatened by black s thirty-third stone

the beginner will wonder that q did not follow r 
this is because r r  would result and white would be at a disadvantage 
the moves are part of a deeply thought-out plan on the part of white 
black could afford to ignore no 
 as long as it stood alone 
thereupon white increases it by nos 
 and and black must accept the sacrifice because otherwise nos 
 are threatened 
by this sacrifice white gets the territory around no 
  and also has an opportunity of increasing his position on line q by his fifty-second move 
 
o 
 
m 
on the fifty-third move black proceeds with the capture of nos 
  and while white on his fifty-fourth move hems in no

perhaps he s the plodding kind --though inever thought he was but i ve got two hundred dollars and it s got tohelp me to something better  i thought you said it was three hundred  so it was but some more bills turned up and had to be paid so it sdwindled 
i ve got it in the savings bank the girl looked at the massive pillar which reared itself before them 
 i should think some of the gold would have stuck to the chimney sheremarked 
her companion suddenly grasped her wrist 
 beth he exclaimed 
his eyes glowed with excitement and he sprangto his feet and whirled his hat around his head as he gave a cheer 
then he stood quite still and gazed at the chimney 
the girl looked at him in wonder 
 what is it she asked 
 i don t know myself--exactly 
maybe it s nothing and maybe --you vefound my fortune  i  yes you  what do you mean  why goosey don t you see it yet 
to buy the right to mine the sootfor gold the gold of the early days 
somehow i ve always felt thatthat would be the stuff to put me on my feet --and here it is 
maybe i ve been mistaken --maybe i wasn t born too late after all  mine the soot 
how can you  why not

 no one s ever thought of this he exclaimed 
 don t you seeit s a big thing he questioned as she did not speak 
 if you can only do it 
will old madge give you leave  he will if i pay him for it 
he d give me the right too to tear downthe old sheds and of course there s gold under the crazy ramshacklethings 
they had so much of it in the early days that they weren t anytoo careful  mr 
madge would be foolish to give you the right if the gold isthere  he is sort of fool-crazy over his mines 
he s always telling every oneall about them how rich they are and all that 
the biggest vein everseen is always just ahead 
he wouldn t come down to mining soot  but wouldn t it be his gold if you found it on his land  no twouldn t 
not any more his than mine 
the works were just amill to crush everybody s ore and what s left is for the sweeper 
besides the land is only leased anyway and if i go open-handed andbuy the right to sweep what i find s mine  i should think that some of it would be his too  i don t see it that way 
a girl s always got such cranky ideas ofbusiness  well we won t quarrel about it until you get it 
shall you put in allyour money  every cent if i have to 
i d like mighty well to have some left though for the expense of working the thing  o ben suppose you shouldn t find any gold  that s the chance i ve got to take 
but you shall have anything youwant beth her face flushed as she saw him glance at her shabby shoes and frock and she tried to cover her feet with the hem of her dress 
 these are trifles she bravely said pointing to them but what ishould like would be more schooling  you shall go to school and before i get any gold either 
i know a wayto fix it  don t anger mr hodges will you ben she turned an anxious facetoward him 
 i won t 
i didn t tell you that i found a note of his for ninetydollars among father s papers  no 
you don t expect to get it  of course not but i can hold it over his head for nearly two yearsyet her face brightened

 see ben eagerly exclaimed there is where the boilers stood 
andthere --he pointed to where some twisted and rusty pipes loosely hungagainst the wall like petrified serpents -- is where the tanks stoodin which they washed the gold 
they washed it before melting it intobricks 
father has told me how the men used to stand knee-deep in it inthe tanks and shovel it out just as if they were shoveling coal  they must have lost a lot  it couldn t be helped 
and no one s ever worked it over  what was that  nothing but a loose shingle in the roof

 you see he continued if i d been taught a trade it would bedifferent or if father had had any business to leave me 
but he wasjust like old madge --wouldn t do anything but trade in mines 
healways had a big fortune just in sight but it never came near enoughto catch  that s a hard way to live  yes 
it wore mother out never to know from month to month whether wewere going to stay or move on or what our income would be 
i believeall old miners are alike 
once a miner always a miner 
the gold feverof early times bewitched them for all the rest of their lives  take care you re not bewitched too  it s entirely different with me he began 
 no it isn t she interrupted 
 but i m with you ben 
o what acrazy scheme it is she laughed at his troubled face 
 what was that 
it is something in the house  it s some one in the yard ben replied looking out 
a man s figure appeared in the doorway 
 good-afternoon mr madge ben said 
 we are viewing your property 
with a floor this would make a first-rate skating-rink the man came toward them 
of medium stature with a halting gait asthough his joints were rusty he helped himself along by the aid of astout hooked cane 
a sparse gray beard covered the lower part of hisface which was flushed from liquor 
he looked uncomfortably warm andhe took off his shabby broad-brimmed hat and ran his fingers throughhis hair until it stood erect in tufts 
 a skating-rink 
like as not twould come down about your heads 
runhome girl he said to beth this is no place for you  we were just going when you came in ben replied before she couldanswer 
 good-night  didn t you want to talk to him about the scheme she asked when theywere out of hearing 
 not when he s in that condition 
i wouldn t take advantage of him 
runhome now before mrs hodges has a chance to scold  she ll scold anyway the girl replied 
then she shrugged hershoulders as if to dismiss an unpleasant subject and her facebrightened 
 race you to the point ben she cried placing one footforward for the start 
he did not respond but gazed at her with a preoccupied air 
 one two still he made no answer 
her expectant attitude changedand her arms fell to her sides while a look of disappointment spreadover her face 
 i think it s just horrid if you re going to be poky andgrown-up 
i don t see why people can t work and play too but it seemsthey never do 
just because you re three years older than me you thinkyou re grown up  why beth what s come over you  you re a man all at once that s all 
i s pose now we can t have anymore fun with stilts and tar-barrels 
nor fly kites nor run races nor--nor do anything we used to do 
i hate the scheme --i do ben laughed 
 come on he said i ll race you off they went flying along the beach until they came up breathless against the wooded slopes of black point 
they climbed up the bankuntil they reached the ramparts 
 that was fine beth said seating herself on the grassy slope 
 now you can tell me some more about your plan 
i don t hate it any more spread before them was the bay dotted with craft 
across the channelthe marin county hills rose abruptly from the water s edge 
at fortpoint which jutted out beyond the promontory on which they weresitting some experiments in a new explosive were being made 
theywatched the flash and report and the little cloud of dust the chargemade when it struck the opposite shore 
above them on a higherembankment a sentry paced to and fro his bayonet glistening in thesunlight 
 so dame trot scolds a good deal does she ben remarked ignoringthe invitation to expatiate on the scheme 
 i must stop calling herthat 
her name s mrs hodges  yes she does 
i don t think she means to though she added 
 ithink she s been disappointed in so many things that it s made hercross with everything 
if it wasn t for poor little sue i couldn tstand it  sue would miss you--if you should go away  i know she would--terribly  you ve thought of going then  o sometimes i think of it but when sue turns her poor little faceand looks at me i can t bear to think any more about it  doesn t she look so at her mother too  yes but her mother always seems to want to get her out of her sight 
she wouldn t hurt her of course but it seems as if she held a grudgeagainst god and sue for her being so deformed 
somehow she acts as ifshe held both of them responsible for the child s misery  most mothers would be more tender to such a child  i know it --just cuddle it up in their arms away from all the restof the world 
but she doesn t 
i guess it s because she s so selfish 
she wants everything of hers to be the best 
of course it isn t and soshe s always complaining  i know 
and i say beth do you know that ill-humor s catching 
idon t like to hear you say that you hate things  you know i don t mean it  then don t say it 
but how are the boys 
are they good to sue  o yes how could they help it 
even hodges is different to her  how s syd 
somehow i ve got sort of turned against him lately  he s just the same old syd 
you say you ve turned against him lately but you know ben ralston that you never liked him ben laughed 
 i can t fool you can i beth 
i think i was trying tofool myself the most 
tell me about him  his mother favors him always and that spoils him 
he s envious andsuspicious always imagining that some one s going to slight him andshe makes this silly feeling worse by encouraging him in it  i know he always looks sidewise at me as though he thought i meantto trip him up or eat his share of the treat or get the best of himsomehow  perhaps you d rather i wouldn t tell him about that place  tell him if you want to but i don t believe you ll get any thanksfor it 
he ll think it s some sort of a trap we ve set for him  how do you suppose he ever got into such a habit  partly disposition partly habit 
it s a habit that grows till aftera while he will not trust any one 
but don t let s talk of him when wecan talk about the scheme 
beth if it pans out i ll always think youwere my fairy godmother  i 
why i haven t done anything at all  yes you have 
you ve shown me the way just like the fairy godmotherwho pointed out the ring in the tree-trunk to aladdin and told him topull and a door would open that would lead down to the treasure-house  that wasn t a fairy godmother it was a magician an old chinaman soi don t feel complimented ben did not reply 
he was busily planning how to reach his treasure 
 i ll have to have machinery and things and at least one man to helpme i suppose he said 
 i don t know exactly what i d better dofirst 
but i can find out he added with a rather blank look 
a few minutes before he had exulted in the fact that he was his ownmaster to negotiate the business and carry it on unaided but alreadyhe found himself wishing for some friend of experience with whom hecould consult 
a few of the difficulties to be surmounted had dawnedupon him 
 why not ask hodges about it  i don t want to do that if i can help it 
i know just how he d sneerand throw cold water on it all  couldn t you find a partner  i m not sure that i want to 
if i let others into it i d be afraidthey d freeze me out 
men with more money than he had did that tofather lots of times  o i hope you won t get cheated ben she clasped her hands andlooked so distressed that he laughed 
 i ll be too many for them 
i d better paddle my own canoe though andthen there won t be any danger  i don t see why there need be any such thing as cheating in the world  it s a queer old world 
mother used to say that sometimes she thoughtit was the lunatic asylum of the universe  i should think for instance that in case you work over the old worksand get out the gold everybody would be glad that you d succeeded and would go on with their own work and earn their own money withoutwanting to cheat you out of yours  i know beth that s the fair way to look at it but all men don tfeel that way 
those that don t are the ones i ve got to look out for  when men are so selfish it makes life just a big fight  yes ben replied 
 and most every man is fierce to down every otherone 
it s just like a big school 
you despise the bullies and sneaks of course but you ve got to look out for them 
i don t mean to leave acrack for a rascal to get the better of me in this business 
i d rathermake forty blunders myself than to have some one jam me in the door  don t you wish you knew whether you could get it or not  yes 
first catch your hare thunder 
i wish i didn t have to waittill to-morrow 
waiting s the hardest thing in the world the cousins slowly walked back on the beach where they had raced ahalf-hour before 
 i ll let you know just as soon as i can ben said at parting 
 yougave me the idea and who knows what ll come of it chapter iithe purchase i d like to speak to you on a matter of business ben s face flushed in spite of the effort he made to look unconcerned and it vexed him that his voice trembled 
the old man addressed surveyed the boyish figure before him 
 business he questioned 
 yes 
it s about the works  well what about em  i should think there d be a good deal of lumber in the frame andbricks in the chimney  yes i s pose there is but what s that to you  i want to know what you ll take for the whole concern as it stands 
isuppose the lease you ve got won t run forever  no i guess it won t mr madge meditated for a moment 
he neededmoney badly to finish a pet tunnel in his bonanza princess mine 
thesum that ben could give would be a small one he knew but it would bebetter than nothing 
as for the lease-- the leas said about that thebetter he said to himself with a chuckle at his own wit 
he sat downon a pile of boards and motioned to ben to take a seat beside him 
thenhe hung his hooked cane on his left arm 
 how much d you have left after your father s affairs was settled up 
must ve been quite a tidy little sum i reckon ben had resolved not to furnish any information in regard to hisfinances unless obliged to do so 
 there wasn t much left after the debts were paid he replied 
 didn t he give you all he had fore he died  yes 
there wasn t any one else to leave it to except my cousin bethmorton and my father knew that if he left her anything mr hodgeswould take it  and you don t mean to tell me t you paid his debts outen it when youwasn t obliged to  every last one of them the boy said with emphasis 
 well ben ralston you are an odd stick he regarded his cane with aspeculative air as though he were comparing it with ben 
 guess i mustbe gittin along hom ards now he added as he slowly rose 
ben was busily speculating upon his intentions 
 the old sharpermeans to find out exactly how much money i ve got and then make astand to get it all he thought 
he instantly decided to furnish theinformation himself 
 i ve got just two hundred dollars --not a cent more --and my board spaid to the first of the month 
so you see i ve got to get to work atonce he said 
mr madge resumed his seat 
 make me an offer he replied with ashrewd glance at ben from his watery eyes 
 that s my offer all i ve got  u-m-m 
it s little enough for the stuff as he paused ben nerved himself for the hardest part of all--thedisclosure of his object in buying the works 
the temptation not tounfold his plan was very strong but he resisted it 
 lumber s tol rable high now the old man continued and it s boundto go higher fore the year s out a remembrance of the lease urgedhim to close the bargain at once 
 but if you re smart enough to sellat a profit--  before we come to a settlement mr madge ben interrupted i wantto tell you of one reason i have in buying your property 
i mean towork over the bricks and soot of the chimney and the ground for gold the old man was visibly astonished 
 so 
for gold 
well that s another thing altogether he remarked as the instinct to get the better of a bargain demanded precedenceover all others 
then a gleam of avarice shone in his eyes 
 tell youwhat boy if you re anxious to mine i kin show you some splendidproperties he waved his cane in his excitement 
 the place to lookfor gold is in a virgin mine not in forty-year-old soot  i don t want any mine that can be bought for two hundred dollars ben said with decision 
 and i must invest in something right off 
ican t leave my offer open either he added as he saw the other make amove to go 
 if i don t buy your ruin i ll have to get into somethingelse  you are in a hurry ain t you 
i wish t i could persude you to gointo a mine 
 tain t no use eh he added as ben shook his head 
 well he rose stiffly i ll see you to-morrow bout it  to-morrow will do 
i ll meet you at the works at ten o clock 
i ve gotsomething on hand for the afternoon ben answered 
when he was alone the boy tried to formulate a plan of operation should he succeed in buying the property 
his most difficult task wasto control his impatience 
 i suppose i ll have to do some more waiting he said to himself 
 howi wish to-morrow were here he knew as well as if mr madge had told him so that his statement inregard to his funds would not be believed without verification 
 he couldn t take my word for it ben reflected but all his diggingcan t bring up anything more than the truth 
it s just two hundreddollars --not a cent more shortly before ten o clock on the following morning ben approachedthe works 
he crossed the lumpy uneven ground of the yard and enteredthe building 
as he gazed at the black walls of the structure andthrough the many holes in the roof where the blue sky looked down hewished that they might speak and foretell the success or failure of hisventure 
the side of the building next to the water was built upon piles driveninto the beach and through an opening in the wall he could see thewaves running back and forth until they almost touched the building 
he was very much excited and involuntarily he kept his hand over thepocket which held his money 
the responsibility of the step he wasabout to take weighed heavily upon him 
never before had he felt soutterly alone in the world 
his visionary father had been the oneheretofore to whom he had naturally turned for advice even when hefelt grave doubts as to his judgment 
now he was about to risk his allin a speculation which might yield no return 
he was buoyant with hope yet the doubt which always accompanies a first trial steadied him 
a rope hung from one of the joists of the flooring and he idly watchedthe waves wash it backward and forward 
at another time he would havequestioned the presence of a deep furrow and some footprints in thesand which the incoming tide was rapidly obliterating but now he wastoo preoccupied to notice them 
he turned and saw mr madge enteringthe building 
 so you got here fore me the old man began 
 it s a good thing tobe prompt 
i don t know of any one thing i like more in a young manthan punctooality 
allers practice it and you ll never be sorry forit he deliberately seated himself 
 i recollec once way back inthe early s how punctooality paid me in one of the pootiest minesthat mortal man ever see 
clear white quartz with lumps of yellow goldpeppered all through it 
 twas this here way he continued as he hunghis cane on his arm-- the mine b longed to a man who d gone back east and hadn t touched a pick to it for most a year so another man and mewas both a-watchin for the day when the year d be up so s we couldtake up the claim ben fidgeted during this recital but the other did not appear tonotice his impatience 
 the other feller continued mr madge he got up at dawn -- twassummer time bout three o clock --but when he clim up the hillto the mine there i was a-settin havin planted my claim twohours before 
i d been there sence midnight he laughed at hisstory regardless of ben s inattention 
 nother time up in thecomstocks --this time i was just a-tellin you bout was in nevadacounty of this state --i recollec how bein prompt saved a good mineand kept a hull concern from goin to rack and ruin 
 twas a silvermine--as beautiful green ore as ever you see--  but i d like to know first --before i hear about it mr madge --whether you re going to accept my offer or not beninterrupted for he could no longer control his impatience 
 well i ve ben thinkin over your offer ben and i ve bout made upmy mind that it ain t no price for the property considerin the goldthat s lyin hid on it 
no price at all in fact--  but it s a chance whether i find any gold or not ben impatientlyexclaimed 
 when you buy a mine do you pay as much for it as you expectto get out of it his heart sank with fear that his offer might not beaccepted 
he felt that he must meet the old man on his own ground andhe was on his mettle 
 it ain t much of a price for the buildin material that s in it let alone the gold mr madge continued as if he had not heard thequestion 
 i ain t willin to let it go at your figure but i ll tellyou what i ll do i ll go shares with you if you ll pay me the twohundred and put up the coin for the machinery 
i s pose a rastra willdo for the crushin  i don t care to take a partner ben firmly replied 
his heart wasgrowing heavier with every second that failure seemed more certain 
he nerved himself for a final effort 
 if you don t care to acceptmy offer mr madge there s no use wasting any more words over thematter he said and turned to go 
a vindictive gleam shot from the old man s eyes 
he did not reply for amoment but stopped ben as he was going out of the door 
 i need the money he briefly said so i ll take your offer but i mjust a-givin it to you ben dived in his pocket with alacrity and produced a bill of sale forthe lumber and bricks and also an agreement permitting him to work overthe ground until the expiration of the lease 
the dates of the latterhe had omitted as he did not know them 
he had opened his purse to pay over the money before he recalled theomission 
it flashed upon him too that the paper should be signed inthe presence of witnesses 
he put his purse back in his pocket 
 come to hodges shop --we must have witnesses ben said 
mr hodges was a locksmith and owned a small shop in the old part ofthe city known as north beach 
he was beth s stepfather and as she wasben s cousin the boy naturally turned to him as a friend 
he looked up in surprise when his visitors entered and gave them agruff welcome 
mr madge was in great haste to sign the papers and get possession ofthe money 
 the dates of the lease must be put in first said ben 
 what arethey  well let me see said mr madge 
 twas thirty-five years ago andwe got it cause twasn t needed by the owners 
afterwards twas madeover to me by the company  that would make it said ben 
he lifted the pen 
 what was themonth  let me see the other replied as if striving to remember 
 we begunin november i think --yes we drove the first pile for the foundationon the fifteenth day of november he brought his cane down witha thump to emphasize the statement 
 i remember the time partic larly  cause twas in that same month that i made a fortune up in tuolumnecounty 
i owned the pootiest mine on the mother lode t ever you see  i think you ve told me about that before mr madge ben replied ashe filled in the dates 
 now this paper gives me the sole right towork over the ground bricks and rubbish of the smelting works untilthe expiration of the lease 
and that will be until-- ben waited formr madge to supply the rest of the sentence 
 certainly it does the latter said 
 you talk like a regular lawyer ben  business is business 
now as i understand it the lease will expireon the fifteenth of november --that s three months off 
the works aremine till then  they re yours until the lease expires replied mr madge withconsiderable impatience 
 i m ready to sign if you are 
let s getthrough with it ben passed the papers toward him and he affixed his signature 
benfollowed with his and then he turned to hodges 
 will you sign here mr hodges he said 
 yes i ll sign the tomfoolery to oblige you replied the locksmith 
but before he put his name to the paper he relieved his mind by makingseveral sneering remarks 
 talk about di monds and coal being the same 
why that won t be init when it comes to findin gold in soot and bricks he said 
 ben you ll be a regular what-do-you-call-it--chemist  an alchemist 
i hope so ben replied with flushed cheeks 
 we oughtto have another witness he added 
a man who was examining some keys in the back part of the shop cameforward 
 i ll sign if you want me to he said 
 i heard the wholebusiness --couldn t help it they agreed and he wrote his name andrew mundon in a good bold hand 
ben then paid mr madge the coveted twenties and the party separated 
ben was eager to make his escape 
he shrank from the coarse sarcasmwhich he knew would be his share if he remained in the vicinity of theshop and he wanted to be alone to think over the matter 
 whew 
i m in for it now he exclaimed as he strode along the street with a hand in each empty pocket 
he threw back his head and steppedbriskly along 
 and i want to tell you one thing right here headdressed himself -- there s to be no looking backward he whistled a lively air and quickened his steps as exciting thoughtscrowded fast upon him 
turning a corner suddenly he collided with aboy of his own age 
 hello syd the boy addressed gave a grunt in reply 
 how do you like the place ben continued 
 o it s well enough for a while 
i ve got another one at forty dollarsa month in view  indeed 
how soon do expect to make the change ben inquired 
 o i ain t going to work for this money long syd aggressivelyreplied as though his employer were doing him an injury 
 i ve hadtwo offers--one ll pay ten dollars more but there s more work andlonger hours 
i haven t made up my mind yet which one i ll take doubt was plainly written in ben s face 
syd always had some suchrose-colored yarn as this to tell about himself 
 you re lucky to have two such good chances ben remarked 
 you llhave to look out and take the right one he turned to go but theother stopped him 
 what are you doing nowadays 
beth said something about your having atiptop place  i don t think she could have said that syd  yes she did too or words to that effect 
you don t mean to doubt myword do you he defiantly added 
 i d rather not ben quietly replied 
 we ve fought all our lives onthe slightest cause and we re too old for that sort of thing now  i don t want to quarrel --but that s what she said  i don t see how that is possible when i haven t any place at all  haven t any 
ain t you working  yes i m going to work --but for myself 
it isn t a secret any longer so you may as well know it since you are so interested in my affairs 
i ve bought the old smelting works to work them for gold ben thoroughly enjoyed making this announcement 
between syd andhimself there had always been a rivalry and after syd s foolishbragging about something that both knew to be false it was asatisfaction to ben to impart his news 
 for gold syd repeated in surprise 
 yes for gold and i expect to find a pile  well i hope you won t be disappointed 
just give me a lump to haveset in a scarf-pin will you he laughed in derision 
 all right --a small nugget will do i suppose 
i must be going now good morning syd gave a grunt in reply and slouched away 
tall and awkward hethrust his head forward when he walked and kept his eyes fixed on theground 
ben turned and watched him for a moment 
 how he would rejoice in myfailure he said to himself 
 it s odd that some people find theirpleasure in just such things 
well i hope he ll not have that joy atmy expense that s all he regretted that he had yielded to the impulse to tell syd 
 i wish i d waited until i could have shown him the color of my gold he reflected 
 perhaps i sha n t find a pinch of it glancing up he saw that he had nearly reached market street and obeying a sudden impulse he crossed that great artery and turned hissteps toward the foundries 
he was glad to have something to divert his thoughts from his interviewwith syd and he spent the rest of the day in looking at machinery more especially that used in mining 
the clash and clamor of the busy hives brought the difficulties of hisundertaking glaringly before him 
his own ignorance seemed appalling 
how could he hope to compete with this skilled labor and wonderfulmachinery 
 i am not competing he told himself 
 i am doing something which noone else has thought of 
the idea is original --here at any rate --andideas can be made to pay chapter iiithe smugglers cache is found s pose you re goin to put in a rastra ben turned and saw the man who had signed as a witness to the agreement 
 how do you do mr mundon he replied 
 yes i think it will need anarastra to crush the bricks his grave face showed that already thecares of the undertaking were preying upon him 
 don t you mind the sneers and laughs of anybody the man said witha sturdy independence that ben liked 
 you ve got a good proposition 
i ve seen it done in australia and a big pile cleaned up 
they do it inthis country too and if this old chap you bought it from didn t havethe mining fever so bad he d have done it years ago  evidently it hasn t occurred to him--or anybody said ben 
 no he s too high to be a gleaner wants real mines with drifts andtunnels and mills to make his money melt 
now f i was goin to do thisjob i d put in a rough rastra--just a round bed of bricks with atwo-foot wall round it ben did not reply but he tried to look wise 
 that s about your plan i reckon  yes the boy said i ve been thinking that an arastra such as youdescribe would be the best thing  then you know all about one of course  no i don t not by a long sight 
i ve seen one at work but i didn tpay much attention to it--i was so young at the time  o in that case p raps you d like to have me describe one to you  i would indeed ben fervently replied 
 well it s just a round bed of bricks with a two-foot wall round it 
i d build that the first thing if i was you and put in the rubbish a little at a time 
you want to put in some quicksilver with it 
theni d get a horse or a mule ter drag round a weight till the bricks andmortar was well crushed  would you put the stuff in wet or dry  wet and you want consid able water too 
i tell you it s pretty tosee how the quicksilver ll pick up most every mite of gold and hug tothe bottom with it ben s eyes shone 
 it must be he said 
 and afterwards--what do youdo next 
i ve heard but i ve kind of forgotten just what comes next  you throw off your coarse stuff from the top and strain thequicksilver through buckskin  will it go through  will it 
well you just ought ter see it come through the buckskintill there s little looking-glass tears all over it  and after that  well you finish it all off in a retort with a long tube 
build a fireunder it and your quicksilver that s left will vaporate leavin thegold behind  i should think you d lose a lot  of quicksilver you mean 
no you don t cause you got ter keep thetube cold and have the end of it sunk in water 
then the quicksilver llcondense again--so you won t lose much of it 
my 
how them lumps ofgold will shine to you eh the boy s eyes sparkled with delight but he only nodded 
he wasthinking very hard 
here evidently was just the man he needed 
hehad seen an arastra at work in one of his father s mines but he knewnothing about the practical details necessary to the constructionof one 
should he offer to employ this man or should he offer hima percentage of the profits 
the latter proposition seemed the morefeasible for although it might cost him more in the end he had noready money to pay out in wages 
his mind was quickly made up 
 i ll tell you what i ll do mr mundon 
if you ll help me with thescheme --i don t mean just by talking but with day s work --i ll giveyou one third of the net proceeds  that s a square offer --seein as how i aint got nothin to putin --and i ll take it 
i m out of a job just now through waitin fura friend from australia 
i expect he ll be here in a month more --ormebbe twill be several --and then we ll try colorado together 
i dreely like this work to fill up the time 
there s something sort ofventuresome bout it that peals to me  and i m very glad to get you to help me ben replied i ve beenworrying a good deal since i bought it  i d thought of it a little myself and i come out here to-day causei kinder thought i d find you a-hangin round somewheres near thisplace  let s go in and look over the ground said ben 
they entered the inclosure and mundon selected the most suitable placefor the arastra 
 the next question is where am i to get the money for the things weneed ben remarked 
 i could get them on credit i think from an oldmining friend of my father s but i hate to go in debt especiallyon an uncertainty 
i ve been thinking about offering him a smallpercentage in exchange for the materials 
then it would be his ownrisk whether he got his money or not  pshaw 
you don t want to give away any more percentages 
a man s gotto go in debt--more or less--in most every business 
besides yourmoney s right in sight as it were  no it isn t ben stoutly replied 
 that s just the trouble i thinkit is but i don t know it 
what right have i to promise to pay a manout of my thinking  there ain t any other way 
you ve just got to do it or borrow themoney from some one else which amounts to the same thing he pausedfor a reply but as he noticed ben s hesitation he hastened to diverthim from his weighing of right and wrong 
 i recollec a chimney on oneof senator fair s mills up in nevada that yielded a pile of gold andsilver when twas broke up 
why they found one solid lump of silverhalf as big as my fist in a crack in the masonry 
you see the goldwhat stays in the furnaces works right into the mortar and bricks ina dust so fine you can t see it 
that s why you need a rastra 
but sometimes fine particles of precip tated silver ll get blown into acrack until there s a big lump formed they peered up the gaping black mouth of the chimney 
the furnaces hadbeen roughly torn out and large openings marked where they had joinedthe chimney 
 tell you what ben exclaimed mundon s pose i skin up and see whati kin see  no let me go the boy eagerly replied 
he was a trifle ashamed of the jealousy he had already begun to feelof this man s wider experience 
if there were lumps of gold and silverglittering in his chimney he wanted to be the first to see them 
 it s a dirty job but i ve got on old clothes he said as he began toclimb up the black funnel 
somehow it was not nearly so sooty as he had expected to find it and the projecting corners of the bricks that afforded him a slightfoothold were quite light-colored 
he had climbed about ten feet when he saw a curious cavity in the sideof the chimney 
a glitter in the dim light made his heart beat veryfast 
striking a taper match he was surprised to see a pile of smalltin boxes nearly filling a cavity in the side of the chimney 
lookingupward he saw several similar breaks in the brickwork 
he took one ofthe boxes and climbed down 
 what have you got cried mundon with more surprise in his voice thangave great credit to the tale he had just recounted 
they bent over the box which emitted a sickishly sweet odor 
 opium mundon exclaimed 
for a moment they looked at each other in silent astonishment 
thenben grasped mundon s arm and dragged him to the gap in the side of thebuilding next the water 
 it s been smuggled he cried 
 and here s where they ve landed theboats he pointed to the beach at their feet 
the waves were stillplaying with the dangling rope s end 
 was there any more questioned mundon 
 whole stacks of it  then you ve got all the money you re in need of many times over 
right in sight this time sure  how so  why don t you know t the law gives an informer thirty-three percent 
of the value of the find 
 course it does 
all you ve got to dois to notify the custom house men of the find n they ll do the rest  you think it s been landed here don t you asked ben 
 sure 
it s ben landed from the china steamers sure s you re born 
there couldn t have ben a better place for em if it had ben made onpurpose 
prob ly they muffled their oars fore they landed  it isn t ten minutes row from the steamers said ben 
 no 
like as not the butcher or some one like that after the ship strade is one of the gang 
you ve seen the flock of small boats thatfollow like gulls after a big ocean steamer ben nodded 
he was stupefied with surprise 
his good fortune seemed toogood to be true 
 tell you what ben like as not those custom house fellers ll want toleave the stuff here and set a watch ter ketch the gang  i don t care what they do--if i can get the money  you can t b lieve it yet eh 
i tell you you re jest as sure of thatthere money as if you had it in your pocket this minute  it s like magic  so tis so tis-- tis the bag at the foot of a rainbow sure enough he pointed at the massive shaft of the chimney 
 fairy gold ben waved the little box at mundon 
 that s all right 
you ll find out that the gold you get for that sas good as twenty-dollar pieces are made of 
want me ter go down andinform or prefer ter do it yourself  i ll go  jest as you say 
you re boss here 
you found it on your property andit s proper you should go 
i ll stay and keep watch chapter ivfunds for the enterpriseben s first impulse was to go home and change his clothes which showedthe contact of dust and soot but it was past three o clock and he wasafraid if he did not make haste he would not see the proper authorities 
he stopped at hodges shop to wash his face and hands 
mr hodges was fitting a key to a metal box 
 hello he remarked as ben hurried past him to the rear of the shop 
 you look as if you d found your fortune already  maybe i have ben replied 
 i ll let you know when i ve verified thefind mr hodge stared 
he had a lurking suspicion that he was being madegame of 
 a young feller always knows it all he commented 
 he s always sococksure  wonder if i am that way thought ben as he pursued his way downthe street 
 anyway i d rather fail than never have been through it 
there s something doing and i m in it he was so preoccupied as he hurried along that once he narrowly escapedbeing run down by a whizzing electric car 
the prospect opening before him fairly made him dizzy with delight 
hefelt that he had suddenly become a man and dimly wondered how it waspossible that a month before he had played shinny and pee-wee withthe other boys as if there were nothing else to live for 
and now--hehad gone into business 
he would succeed--he must succeed 
mingled with his delight at his sudden good luck there was a feelingof relief that he had resisted the temptation to go into debt 
at length he came in sight of the custom house a dilapidated brickbuilding the first floor of which was used as the main post-office 
ben slowly climbed the winding stone stairs 
he suddenly wanted moretime than the elevator would allow to think of how he should tell hisstory 
after a short delay he was ushered into the presence of the collectorof the port 
ben explained his plan and his accidental discovery of theopium 
he fancied that the official and a gentleman who was sitting in theroom seemed to be much more interested in his scheme to work over thebricks and rubbish of the old smelting works for gold than they werein the discovery of the opium 
he noted that the visitor was addressed as mr 
hale and he wonderedif he were the well-known lawyer of whom he had heard 
this gentlemanasked ben several questions in relation to his plan and although hiseyes and voice were kind the boy s sensitive spirit shrank under thetone of the questioner 
the amusement in his eyes seemed to foretellthe failure of the venture 
the attention of the chief being called to other matters he sent fora deputy to whom he referred ben s case 
this official also appearedto be much interested in ben s private affairs and plied him withquestions some of which were apparently irrelevant 
nettled he knew not why by the man s manner and questions benfinally asserted himself 
 i bought the property to work over for what i could get out of it hesaid 
 by accident i found a lot of opium hidden on the premises andi expect to get the thirty-three per cent 
which the law allows thelook which accompanied this speech said plainer than words now whatare you going to do about it mr cutter meditatively regarded the speaker 
 we ll set a watch thereto-night and catch some of the gang if we can he finally remarked 
 you re a pretty smart boy --he brought his hand down on ben sshoulder -- can you keep a secret ben nodded 
 see that you do then 
and caution the friend who was with you to tellno one --absolutely no one 
such news goes like wildfire  we wouldn t be apt to tell and run the risk of losing the reward  umph 
some folks couldn t keep a secret if their lives depended uponit 
that s all he curtly added 
 when i want you i ll send for you without knowing why ben mistrusted this man 
 cutter is your name andi sha n t forget you he said to himself as he retraced his steps tonorth beach 
mundon was anxiously awaiting his return 
 did they snub you 
did you see the head he asked 
ben related his experience 
 you were in luck to see the collector commented mundon 
 my belief is that the chief s all right in such cases --a big manwho won t stoop to no dirty business and who ll listen to a feller sstory and treat him fair 
he s got a sense of what he s ben put inoffice for by the people to serve the people 
but a smarty clerk whotakes delight in snubbing the people who really give him his bread andbutter--deliver me from him 
he s gen rally a failure a ne er-do-well who s got his place through his second cousin s husband havin a pull and because he couldn t support himself and had to be taken care of byhis family --and he just thinks he runs this whole government  they ll be here about dark i suppose ben remarked 
 i m going towatch too  well i think i ll be excused mundon remarked 
 in my opinion thereain t one chance in a hundred of their catchin em  why shouldn t they catch them if they come back here for the opium ben innocently inquired 
 why boy there s more plaguey ramifications to a gang like that 
from what you ve told me it wouldn t surprise me to find that thisman cutter s in it himself 
most likely every move you ve made hasben known to em and they d hev taken the stuff away if they d got achance all that night the custom house men kept a watch at the works 
ben watched with them looking off on the waters of the bay andlistening for the dip of muffled oars 
more than once he fancied heheard the smugglers approaching and his heart beat fast as he waitedto be sure before calling the men 
he felt a great distaste for his position and correctly attributedmundon s refusal to join in the watch to the same reason 
when morningdawned he experienced a distinct relief that nothing had occurredduring the night to place him in the position of an informer 
chapter vben s partner proves a trumpthe watch was continued for several nights but in vain 
as none cameto claim the opium it was taken away and a valuation of two thousanddollars was placed upon it of which ben s share amounted to nearlyseven hundred dollars 
it did not seem possible that those little boxes filled with a stickysubstance which looked like very black and thick molasses could beworth so much 
the readiness with which a broker advanced ben the moneydue on his claim however was tangible evidence and he found no faultwith the exorbitant rate of interest exacted 
there was one phase of the affair that was most unpleasant to ben --thesuspicion with which the government officials regarded mundon andhimself 
 some one blabbed one of them pointedly said to him or else theparties who stowed that stuff away would have come back for it another time he overheard one man remark to another i don t agreewith you 
i think the boy s honest enough but that fellow with himlooks like a slippery one  but the boy s the one who gets the reward  i know 
but that fellow ll get it out of him before he s through withhim a thought that this might be true came into ben s mind but hedismissed it at once as unworthy 
yet it is hard to get rid of avicious weed and this doubt presented itself to him from time to time 
mundon proved more useful to ben as time went on and his own ignoranceand inexperience became more marked 
he congratulated himself manytimes upon the good luck which had sent this man across his path 
 gee-willikens mundon 
how are we ever going to get this chimneydown ben looked up at the massive pillar of brick which reared itselfabove him 
 it looks about a mile high when you stand close to it 
why he added with a blank look it ll take us months to level it  you was a-calculatin to level it mundon laconically asked 
 of course 
how else can we work over the bricks that are in it  um 
how d you think you d git it down  well--that s what s worrying me 
i had a sort of plan to scrape downthe soot 
but the bricks--how are we going to get at them  your idee is good--as fur as it goes but i think i can give you abetter one than scrapin the chimney of soot  let s have it  i d rig a cross-piece--shaped just like a cross--to work inside thechimney from a rope over the top like an elevator ben caught his breath 
 how would you ever get a rope over the top heasked 
 o that s easy 
i haven t ben a sailor fur nothin 
then i d chip offthe whole inside of the chimney  we d work just the inside  that s all we want ain t it 
it s the golden linin we re after 
wedon t want the rest  no and it will save time and strength to leave the rest alone  we ll leave the balance of the bricks for those that come after us 
 twon t hurt the chimney a mite neither  mundon you re a brick exclaimed ben 
mundon waited a moment before replying 
he liked the frank admirationthat shone in ben s eyes 
 there ain t nothin sure in this world ben and it s mighty oncertainsometimes to draw conclusions from things you ve ben told 
what s more you can t b lieve all you hear  you re preparing me to be disappointed mundon said ben 
 but i mbracing myself for that too 
i know it s a chance  most everythin is-- cept runnin a peanut-stand near a monkey s cage ben laughed 
 how you re ever going to get a rope over that top helooked up and shook his head in despair 
 no fear--i ll manage that 
just let me get some stuff for ascaffoldin and i ll show you the trick in a jiffy  you re a wonder ben replied 
the question as to what he should have done without mundon s helpoccurred to him again but he did not express it 
 i heard when i was up town this mornin that there was goin to be asale of mules to-morrow  you think we ll need one to work the arastra  couldn t hev nothin better 
this sale s goin to be at a horse-marketout near the potrero 
s pose you see if you kin get one cheap  yes i ll go to the sale ben paused 
 i say mundon what ischeap--for a mule  bout fifteen dollars ought to git one good enough at an auction  that was about the figure i had in mind 
of course i don t ask youropinion mundon so much to get advice as i do to compare notes 
i liketo see if your judgment and mine agree mundon did not look up but went steadily on with his work 
 iunderstand--of course he replied 
chapter vithe mule auction a mule is very much like a horse isn t it ben questioned on thefollowing morning 
 yes they are somewhat similar mundon replied going on with thetask of untangling some old harness 
 yet they re different too  that s so they are ben did not like to admit his ignorance but he very much desired somefurther information on the subject of mules before he entered the arenaof the auction 
he had a guilty consciousness that he had made mundonfeel that he resented his superior wisdom in many things connected withtheir undertaking and that he was unreasonably jealous of his worldlyknowledge 
he regretted and was ashamed of his ingratitude toward thisman who had proved invaluable to him and he hoped that the other wouldoverlook it 
 if you were going to buy a horse mundon what particular points wouldyou look for in the animal  well i d see that he had a broad forehead good straight clean legs round hoofs small ears clear eyes and most of all a wide chest 
but of course these don t hold good in a mule  no i suppose not  then he oughter be in good perportion 
i ve seen horses with afine-lookin front and a back all shrunk up 
and i ve seen some witha fine back and a front that had a stunted look 
an animal like thatain t apt to have much strength or wearin qualities 
then there sexceptions 
i remember one of the best horses for pullin i ever sawhad a sort of stunted front 
but of course none of these things holdgood in a mule  no nothing seems to apply to a mule ben picked up a strap whichdangled from the harness and began untangling it 
 haven t the teethsomething to do with it  sure 
they re the most important point cause that s the way you kintell a horse s age--by his teeth 
if they re long he s old 
you wantto see that they ain t ben filed too  do you think the point about the teeth would apply to a mule benasked 
 there ain t nothin that applies to a mule except--patience 
you vegot to have everlastin patience when you come near a mule 
but they re knowin 
lordy 
i ve had em teamin up in the mountains whenthey knew a sight more n most men 
i d talk to em just like they washumans 
 sal i d say don t you know better n to hug so close tothat bank and before the words was out of my mouth sal would bea-standin way off from the bank 
and all i had to do to git one of em over the chain --there s a chain runs between em in place of apole you know and mebbe i d have sixteen or twenty strung along inpairs --and if i wanted to git one of em over it i d jest call out thename and that mule would jump the chain quick as lightnin 
a horsehas got a heap of sense but in my opinion a mule kin discount himevery time  we re safer then in buying a mule than a horse  law yes 
for the work you want done you are  well i ll be going along i guess remarked ben 
 i want to lookover the field before the sale begins  that d be a good idee ben boarded an electric car which crossed the city 
he was dubious asto his ability for the task he had undertaken and regretted that hehad not asked mundon to go in his place 
he ran over the directionsfor buying a horse 
 round-hoofed small-eared broad-headed clear-eyed short-teethed clean-legged wide-chested and good-proportioned he enumerated 
 i mprimed for a horse-sale if i ever need to go to one but i m all atsea about a mule mundon had seemed to be singularly averse to offering to make thepurchase ben reflected although he had been given ample opportunityto do so and he was so well qualified to select exactly the animalneeded 
he had appeared anxious to get ben out of the way 
could it be possiblethat he meant to make the attempt to get the rope over the top ofthe chimney during his absence 
how would he manage it 
it seemed acolossal impossible task 
the car clanged its bell along kearny street whizzed across marketand swung into third street on its way to the potrero 
a wild ideaoccurred to ben 
 if there s a mule in the inclosure that points hisears at me i ll buy him he decided 
association with his father had implanted superstition in the boy scharacter 
ben had seen it sway his father many times as indeed itexerted an influence more or less potent upon all miners 
a recollection of the sum he had resolved to expend reminded ben thatthe occult must be confined within the limits of fifteen dollars 
 i don t know the first thing about it anyway and i might as well beguided by chance as anything else he reflected 
he was a trifle ashamed of this decision and half hoped that the mulesthemselves would render its execution impossible by all laying back orall pointing their ears in unison 
when he entered the gate of the vacant lot where the sale was to beheld a rough-haired forlorn-looking specimen of a mule raised twoweather-beaten ears and disconsolately surveyed him 
 that settles it said ben to himself 
 after all it s something tohave the matter decided for one the man in charge was anxious to show ben the superior animals withinthe inclosure but he manifested so little interest in them that theirowner began to have doubts as to his being a bona fide purchaser 
 like as not the rest will all go above my price thought ben but ithink i can get despair -- for so he had designated the mule he hadsettled upon-- for fifteen it was a long wait and ben was anxious to return to the works but theowner seemed to be in no hurry to begin and evidently was waitingfor a larger audience 
when a dozen or more men had arrived the sale was opened 
it wasconfusing the way in which the auctioneer rattled on discoveringinvisible buyers in corners and on the outskirts of the crowd 
ben wondered how he should be able to keep his head when his timeshould come and he realized that this thought made his heart beatrapidly 
he witnessed some close buying that was bewildering to theinexperienced and he saw one man badly kicked by the glossiest plumpest mule in the lot 
 another mark in favor of despair ben noted 
 you can t tellanything by looks but i don t believe he d do that it was late in the afternoon before the mule which ben hadselected--or rather the mule which had selected ben--was offered 
 we ll start him at-- what ll we start him at gentlemen  five dollars said a voice 
 five dollars the auctioneer scornfully repeated 
 somebody hereexpects to get a good workin animal for nothing just because hiscoat s a little rough 
five dollars would be just a-givin him away 
why all he needs to be a playmate for the children is a clippin and ared ribbon tied round his tail 
what am i bid bid bid--what am i bid 
ten dollars young man did you say he pointed to ben and the latternodded 
 here s a young gentleman who knows a good animal for the saddle whenhe sees one this sally brought a laugh from the crowd and added to ben sdiscomfiture 
 ten dollars 
who ll raise the bid 
twelve he pointed to a man on theedge of the group 
 who ll give me twelve dollars for this reliablemule 
twelve dollars  fifteen said ben 
a smile rippled over the faces of the crowd and ben became painfullyconscious that he had made an error 
he could feel his face growinguncomfortably warm 
 fifteen dollars called the auctioneer 
 will no one raise it 
isthere no one here wants this mule more than this young gentleman 
fifteen once--fifteen twice--fifteen three times and sold to-- --heturned expectantly toward ben -- mr --  ralston said ben 
the money was paid and ben started for the works with his purchase 
 you must hev wanted that mule powerful bad young feller a bystanderremarked as the pair issued from the gate 
 think so the boy replied anxious to make his escape 
 yes--it rather looks as though you did 
to wait till the last andworst-lookin mule in the bunch was offered the man continued andthen to raise your own bid twice there was a laugh from the crowd 
 you could hev got him for twelve dollars sure and you might hev gothim for ten  well that s my affair ben retorted 
he led the mule along a street in the direction of the city notwithout a misgiving however as to the docility of the animal 
a fearthat he might balk or suddenly whirl and kick to the amusement ofthe spectators made ben eager to increase the distance between themule-market and himself 
it was a long distance from the potrero to north beach for they markedopposite boundaries of the city and ben had ample opportunity forreflection 
he made a detour and skirted the sea-wall in order toavoid the more crowded streets 
as he trudged along the mule seemeddocile and easily led but ben bought some carrots from a passingvegetable-wagon to make assurance doubly sure 
he regretted that he had yielded to the impulse of trusting to chance 
he was conscious that the act was unworthy and degrading that he hadtaken a step backward 
 if i m going to act in that fool way he said to himself there sno telling where i ll land 
it s as bad as the things tom sawyerdid --worse because he didn t trust an important piece of business toblack art 
it s just the kind of thing that the lowest order of a negrowould be capable of 
but no one knows it he added with emphasis norever shall 
 despair and i can keep the secret 
that name won t do--itmight hoodoo the scheme he turned and reflectively surveyed the mule 
 you ve got to have a name that s a winner 
a cheerful humming booming sort of a name he said 
as if in reply the animal raised his long ears and pointed them at hisinterlocutor 
when they reached montgomery avenue where mr hodges shop wassituated ben pulled his hat over his eyes 
he endeavored to hasten thepace of the mule 
in this he was unsuccessful but fortunately therewas no one in sight whom he knew 
 if i were sure of success i wouldn t mind the whole town s seeingevery move i make the boy reflected 
 but it makes a heap ofdifference in people s opinions whether you succeed or not 
if youdon t then you re looked upon as a fool and everything you vedone is fool-business but if you do then you re called wise andeverything you ve done is smart as lightning they reached the slight rise and began to descend toward the bay 
outlined against the vista of the blue water washing the base of thesausalito hills rose the massive pillar of the chimney 
ben paused an instant in amazement 
mundon had been true to his word for reaching from the top to the bottom was a cable that looked thethickness of a thread against the solid round bulk of the chimney 
ben could hardly believe his eyes 
how had it been accomplished 
he was obliged to control his impatience until the mule s deliberategait brought them at length to the works 
 mundon where are you ben called as he dashed into the building 
 ahoy there a voice replied from the flue 
peering up the mouth ben saw mundon on a cross-piece which wasfastened by two lines to the main rope after the manner of a trapeze 
 i ll do the chippin mundon remarked from his perch about twentyfeet from the ground 
 take your head away a minute and we ll drive thefirst blow ben retreated and mundon struck the chisel he held a blow that sentdown a shower of soot broken brick and mortar 
 we ll soon know now ben said to himself and his heart beat rapidly when he thought of all it meant to him 
chapter viibuilding the arastra we ve got to find a place to keep the mule 
it s too cold to leave himoutside said ben 
 that s easy mundon replied 
 one of the sheds ll do first-rate 
he ll have a box-stall --same as a racer  i ll fix it up for him right now 
he looks sort of forlorn tied outthere in the fog said ben 
 there s two other animals we ought to find quarters for too  two others 
o you mean ourselves  yes 
with all this room goin to waste why shouldn t we get our roomrent free  that s a good idea mundon 
we ll have to do it or hire a watchman as soon as we begin to work the stuff 
we might as well get used to itfirst as last  i ll build the room for us 
over there against that east wall will bea good place for it  perhaps there won t be anything to need watching ben said with agrim smile but we ll soon know now  there s got to be somethin 
it ain t in reason that there ain t nogold left over in all this mess emphatically replied the other 
 well we ll hope so till we know to the contrary 
we ll have to havesome furniture i suppose  furniture  why a couple of beds anyway  o i ll knock up a couple of bunks that ll do for the time we llbe here 
i can make first-rate arm-chairs too --reg lar sleepyhollers --out of those barrels  that ll be fine 
i suppose we d better use the boards out of thatfirst shed  no i d put the mule in that one 
then he d be farther away from ourquarters 
i d knock down the second shed the one where the roof ishalf gone 
found a name yet fur your mule  i ve named him alchemist  alchymist 
don t that mean turnin no count things inter gold  yes  well that s propriate cause he ll work the rastra 
then we kincall him alchy till we know the result and if we don t get anythin worth mentionin out of it we kin call him missed that ll be propriate too  alchy goes then 
and here s to be his home 
i think i ll leave onewindow for his professorship 
we ll separate his apartments from ours he struck the dilapidated shed a blow as he spoke 
 twill be more ristocratic observed mundon 
 s pose i start the rastra while you re doin that  wish you would 
everything seems unimportant--where we sleep or wherethe mule sleeps--compared to the real business  a man s got to be comfortable or he can t do good work 
this here sthe best place for the rastra he took several long steps across aspot in the center of the floor 
 i ll level this off a little so tohave the floor of it even  you re going to use those bricks ben pointed to some bricks whichmarked the location of the furnaces 
 i was calculatin to 
but first we ve got to remember that we ve gotto have a furnace too  we have 
what for  why we ve got to melt our gold--after we git it  o 
well why not leave that part of the old furnace that s standingthere  i was a-thinkin of doin that 
we ll build a rough chimney on theoutside  then we ll have to have a crucible  yes that s another thing i was goin to mention 
ever seen itdone--gold melted in one  yes i ve been watching them do it in smith s assay office  o you have have you  yes 
and the other day i went to the mint and saw a lot 
mr hale the gentleman i met at the custom house gave me a card 
it s funny mundon how different everything there looked to me from the last timei was there 
every schoolboy in this town goes and of course i went but it didn t seem to me that i could be the same boy who d been there 
everything interested me so much more this time mundon had been marking a circle in the center of the floor 
 now ben he said we re ready for the corner-stone and you re theproper person to lay it 
you just git one of those bricks and put ithere he struck the center of the circle a blow with his spade 
 i didn t know you could corner a circle said ben as he placed abrick upon the spot indicated 
 you kin corner anythin if you only find out how to do it 
there he added with satisfaction the first brick s laid 
now she ll goa-hummin  let me help you said ben 
 it s more interesting than building themule-shed 
i can fix that by-and-by  all right mundon watched ben lay the bricks 
 how clumsy i am the latter exclaimed when the bricks refused to lieevenly 
 i ve often watched bricklayers at work 
it looks as easy asbreathing but it isn t --not by a long sight  it s a trade mundon laconically remarked 
 then you must be jack of them all said ben for there s nothing youcan t do  i ve ben in most of em 
it s mean to try to do things when you don tknow how 
sometimes a job i wasn t used to would take a powerfullong time though in the first stages i thought i was workin mightyfast--a reg lar lightnin -striker  of course anything that isn t regular work takes longer  exactly 
the more you work at a thing the more skillful you git 
sometimes when i d git through with a new worrisome job i d wonderwhat i d better tackle next 
and t would always remind me of a storymy mother used to tell bout a tailor who was a powerful slow worker but thought he was lightnin 
he took a whole week to make a vest andthen said what ll i fly at next during the following two weeks the partners were very busy 
the arastrawas finished and the furnace in readiness for the precious metals 
lastly a pile of soot brickdust and mortar representing a part ofthe lining of the chimney and a retort and some quicksilver awaitedthe trial 
a fairly good sleeping-room with a tiny galley adjoining made theplace comfortable 
mundon proved to be a good cook and ben was fond of watching him athis culinary labors 
the kitchen was constructed like the galley of aship and when the cook was seated everything was within his reach 
 i ve been camping out in vacations ben remarked but this beatsthat all to pieces  it s cause this combines business with pleasure mundon replied as he neatly cut long fingers of potato preparatory to frying them 
 there s twice as much fun to be had in doin the work you really liketo do than there is in anythin that s called fun  so i ve found out  fun s like society 
when it hunts you --comes of its own accord natural like --it s fine 
but when you hunt it it don t amount toshucks  i guess you re about right 
i know i ve never enjoyed anything in mylife as i have this  cause why 
 cause it s work you like 
that s the reason 
but it takessome folks a lifetime to find that out and even then they don t seeit ben was looking at the pile of rubble as if fascinated 
 how much longer before we know  it won t be long now i reckon  o mundon how can i ever wait on the following morning mundon went down-town to make some necessarypurchases 
 i heard something to-day he said when he returned that i wish i dknown in the beginnin  what s that inquired ben 
 why you see when i was inquirin bout the price of quicksilver irun up against a man as knew all about this sort of thing--or said hedid 
 course i didn t tell him our plan but what he says is neededfur it is a jigger  a what  a jigger machine 
i got him to describe it and i think i ve gotenough idee as to how it s made to make one myself 
he d used one upin nevada he said mundon extracted a piece of chalk from his pocket and on the boardwall he drew a plan of the machine 
 your jigger is a box made of wood he said 
 well really it sa tank--six foot long by four high 
you fill it with water 
at oneend you have a tray filled with dirt and hung from a pole which isbalanced by a weight at the end 
t other end of the pole works up anddown like the handle of a bellus 
the tray is dipped into the tankand all the loose dirt is washed out and the gold sinks to the bottom 
that s the coarse gold you ve got to ketch the fine gold on a tablein the tank under the tray 
the waste dirt works inter the fur partof the tank 
this man says--and he seems ter know what he s talkin about--that you can t git the val able particles nohow without ajigger  what luck you were in to meet him  wasn t i though 
i believe i ll git the lumber --it oughter be madeout of new lumber --and knock the thing together this afternoon mundon replied as he walked to the rear wall of the building 
 say ben he remarked picking up a little of the earth from the floor andletting it sift through his fingers i think we oughter locate ourfind a little before we begin operations  what do you mean  why this here place is like a ruin deserted by the folks who used tolive here 
for instance he pointed to some grass-covered excavations  these were the furnaces  well said ben thoughtfully then if they followed the process usedin all smelting-works the bullion was melted in crucibles and castinto bars  exactly 
then jest use your natural sense and think out how they gotthe bars ter the bullion-room 
why they piled em on hand-cars andrun em on a track he suddenly knelt down and ran his hand along theground in front of the excavations 
 here s the groove where the trackwas laid --sure s you re born ben dropped beside him 
 there is a groove he cried 
 we re regulardetectives mundon  it couldn t run anywhere else the other said as if to himself 
 than to the bullion-room 
of course it couldn t and it didn t 
itran over there didn t it ben pointed to the opposite wall 
 yes said mundon it must 
my 
they were careless in those days ifthis was like any smeltin -works ever i see and i s pose it was 
theyjest slung the stuff round like it was mud 
they always counted onlosin lots of it in splashin  i should think so 
with no flooring in the furnace-rooms and all thisdust being trampled into the earth floor year after year i shouldthink they d have lost a fortune  mebbe they did  we hope so for they made enough as it was  you see sometimes a furnace would get ter leakin 
well mebbe twould be quite a while before anybody found it out 
then p rapsthey d run tons of base bullion inter a trench thinkin they d go overthe ground when they got time 
um-- well sometimes they never got thetime they was so busy makin money 
we must look round some time fur traces of a trench of that sort  i ve got an idea said ben that it would be a good plan to wash thesoil here and there with an ordinary gold-pan 
we could tell something i should think about where the richest dirt lay then  twouldn t do no harm 
but the richest dirt is bound ter be near thefurnaces and in the bullion-room 
we ll finish with the chimney first  cause if there are any nuggets they ll be there  wouldn t any tin pan do  o you better have the real thing 
i see one a-hangin up outside of ajunk-shop on stockton street that i ll git when i go to git the lumber 
mebbe it might be a relic of and give you some of the spirit ofthose days 
not that you ain t got the true minin spirit already headded with a glance at ben s eager face 
on the following day the pan was purchased and ben was initiated andbecame for the first time a real miner 
he scooped some dirt from whatwas thought to be a favorable spot put it in the pan and poured somewater upon it 
mundon showed him how to shake the pan from side to side allowing alittle water to flow constantly from the top until a small amount ofvery ordinary-looking dirt remained in the bottom 
it was exhilaratingto think of what it might contain 
 it looks exactly like the mud pies my mother s boy used to make saidben with an anxious air 
 there s a little color there or i m mistaken mundon wiselyremarked as he scanned the sediment 
 yellow s the color i m looking for  well there s some yellow in that 
hold it up to the light 
now itdoes shine 
i ll be hanged if it don t  goodness knows i want to see it as much as any one said ben buti m afraid this is too much like imagination 
it reminds me of the timepeople thought they saw flying-machines in the sky mundon shook his head 
 i ain t that kind he remarked as he returnedto his work of constructing the jigger after all he continued  you can t tell much about it till you make the speriment in theproper way 
this machine ll settle it one way or the other he worked rapidly and skillfully and by the following night the jigger was completed 
 my he exclaimed as he drove the last nails 
 it was luck blindluck my meetin that feller and his tellin me jest exactly what iwanted to know  one thing will be very funny said ben 
 i was just thinking thatwe ll have to ship our bullion--when we get it--up to the searbysmelting works at vallejo to be resmelted and cast into bars 
they werethe original owners of it  funny enough for us mundon replied 
 but i don t count on shippin  em any  how ll we get it into bars  i ll git it into bars myself 
you didn t know that i was an assayer too did you  no ben thoughtfully replied 
 i think i ve found my trade at last 
mundon if i ve got brains enough i ll be an assayer  why not a mining engineer 
might as well aim fur the highest whileyou re about it  that s so 
but that takes more money 
if i get enough out of this i ll try for it chapter viiigold in the jigger  it s nearly time for us to know bout where we stand remarkedmundon as he flung several shovelfuls of mortar brickdust and sootinto the jigger he then added some quicksilver to the mass 
 there i guess that ll do fur this time 
now we ll churn the cream and see ifwe kin git any butter  perhaps it isn t cream ben suggested more to hear mundon reassurehim than anything else 
 no p raps it ain t --p raps it s only skim milk 
well in that casewe won t git any butter 
but i m a-bettin on it s bein cream when mundon took some of the amalgam from the dirty water and washed itclean ben knew that the time of reckoning had arrived 
 ain t feelin faint are you ben mundon facetiously inquired 
 iorter brought some smellin -salts along 
well i ve got a ticklish sortof feelin myself he placed the amalgam in a piece of buckskin 
this he squeezed untilthe larger part of the quicksilver had been pressed through the skin 
he did not tell ben but he knew from long experience that the resultwas satisfactory 
ben read his thoughts in his face 
 tell me it s all right mundon 
i can see by your face that it is buti d like to hear you say it 
tell me  there s gold in this ball--or i m not alive the other replied 
 wo-o-w ben flung his cap among the rafters and seizing the ball ofamalgam he sent it after the cap 
 here young feller don t you go plumb crazy 
that s heavy 
want terkill us 
give me that ball--i ain t through with it yet ben returned the ball 
 i had to let off steam or bust he said 
 now we ll see what we ll see said mundon as he repeated theprocess he had followed with the first handful of amalgam until he hadthree good-sized lumps 
 the gold s inside of them ben asked 
 course it is --that is we ve reason to s pose so  how ever are we going to get it out 
i say mundon i d have made apretty fizzle of this business without you  you d have had to found somebody else that s all mundon modestlyreplied 
 next i take the retort --see that it s cold --and chalk it well 
watch me ben --most anybody can set an egg on end after they ve seenit done 
next i wrap these here baseballs--base is good --in paper andput em in the retort --so 
then i jam the cover down tight 
now giveme a lift ben 
this here s pretty heavy i reckon the retort did not seem heavy to ben as they lifted it to the furnace and he concluded that mundon had asked him to help him in order thathe might feel that he was more than a spectator 
 he s got the finest feelings ben said to himself 
 he s alwaystrying to make a fellow feel comfortable they built a roaring fire in the furnace 
 now you kin tend that fire fur two hours ben said mundon whilei go down-town and see bout gittin some more coal and a few littlethings we need 
i ll be right back 
don t forget--you got to keep thatthere retort red-hot the whole time  yes yes 
and then what do we do  well you got to keep the retort red-hot for two hours as i toldyou just a dull red-hot but at the last you pile on the coal tillit s a reel cherry-red  and after that  o i ll be here to show you what to do afterwards during the following two hours ben watched the furnace and plied itwith coal 
a rap on the doors attracted his attention and he admittedbeth and little sue 
 mother asked us to tell her when you got the first gold from yourgolconda 
have you got any yet sue asked 
 i know what that means too for beth told me the story  not yet sue ben replied 
 maybe you re just in time to see some though 
we re nearly ready to open the retort he flung in a shovelfulof coal 
 i m glad you came down beth to see it for if we get anyit ll be the result of your idea  nonsense ben 
o sue she exclaimed as she looked up the long funnelof the chimney to where it pierced the blue sky think of any one ssitting on those little sticks and being hoisted up that frightfuldistance 
it makes me dizzy to think of it 
how did you ever get therope over the top she inquired of ben 
 mundon did it ben explained one day when he sent me off to buythe mule  did he climb up on the outside  no goosey of course not 
he built a rough scaffolding inside somehow as he went along until he could throw a rope over the top 
the rest was easy  and is he going to chip off the whole inside 
o-o-h 
how can he bearto sit on that thing and let you haul him to the top  o he doesn t mind it he s been a sailor 
he says it s safer thanlots of high places he s been in because there s no wind so interested had all three been in peering up the chimney thatthey had not noticed the entrance of several men who were curiouslyinspecting the interior 
sydney chalmers was one of them and while ben was annoyed by hispresence at this particular time he did not like to ask him to leave 
syd walked about with a supercilious stare which so irritated benthat he relieved his feelings by flinging shovelfuls of coal into thefurnace 
the two hours were nearly up and mundon must soon return 
one of the self-invited visitors proved to be a reporter who walkedabout notebook in hand scanning the surroundings 
when mundon returned ben suggested that the strangers be asked toleave but mundon did not approve of this 
 it never did anybody any harm to be on the good side of thenewspapers and it gen rally does a body heaps of harm to be on the badside of em he sagely remarked 
 let him get his scoop 
that s a realcherry-red he added as he looked at the retort 
 give us a hand ben they lifted the retort from the furnace 
 it s got to chill now said mundon and he turned his attention tothe reporter whom he regaled with such munchausen tales that thatexperienced gentleman had hard work to separate fiction from fact 
 s pose you think your fortune s in sight syd contemptuously lookedat the retort 
 i hope so syd and i know all my friends do too ben replied 
 hoping s cheap ben turned away 
 isn t it cool enough yet he called to mundon 
 reckon it is said mundon 
 now when i knock off the cover we gotto jump back quick as lightnin 
the fumes of quicksilver s deadly youknow  all right 
knock her off ben responded 
 you folks better stand well back mundon said to the others 
he struck the cover a few hard blows and as it flew off they sprangback to a place of safety 
 whew 
this is being an alchemist with a vengeance 
fancy our turningthat old rubble into gold ben said to mundon who was holding him bythe arm 
 o i say isn t it time to see now  i guess so 
come along visitors and workmen eagerly crowded around the retort 
a little spongeof gold was all that remained in it 
mundon took it out and weighed it while the others curiously watchedhim 
ben was visibly horribly disappointed 
he had a sickening convictionthat the whole thing was a failure 
he could read the triumph in syd sface and it cost him an effort to put on a bold front and see them allthrough the gates 
 it s no go i m afraid he whispered to beth 
for answer she pressedhis hand 
he closed the gates and turned to mundon 
 well --it s a failure 
you needn t tell me--i know it  failure 
no tain t a failure  are you saying that to let me down easy  before god i ain t 
why boy what you got tears in your eyes fur 
brace up and be a man  i m trying to mundon ben s voice shook 
 i dunno what s this all about 
did you expect that there crucible d behalf-full of gold 
mebbe you thought twould be plumb full there wasno reply 
 why on a rough calculation i reckon this undertakin sgoin to come out all right  you mean that it s going to pay  course i do 
what ails you  it seems such a small quantity ben faltered 
 it ll seem smaller yet when it s cast in a bar 
i ve got to meltthis again to git it into shape 
besides i reckon bout half of it ssilver  silver 
and silver s worth only fifty cents an ounce ben sat down onsome lumber and gloomily watched mundon melt the gold in a crucible 
 yes so tis but gold s worth twenty dollars an ounce 
didn t expect twould be all gold did you 
i m a-figurin roughly on the tons ofstuff you ve got in sight and the amount of gold you ve got out of onejiggerful and--you ve got a good thing all right ben 
but you rejust like all kids --beggin pardon --onreasonable chapter ixthe mysterious chineseon the night following the first clean-up ben was awakened aboutmidnight 
he had been sleeping so heavily that for some minutes afterawakening he did not realize where he was 
then the outlines of therough walls of the room and the regular breathing of mundon recalledhim to his surroundings 
he was too wide-awake to sleep again and hereviewed the events of the day and then fell to speculating upon theplans for the morrow 
suddenly he sat bolt upright every faculty alert 
there was a sound ofstealthy footsteps in the outer room 
ben knew now the cause of his sudden awakening 
some one had enteredthe building and was creeping about searching for--what 
 the gold he instantly replied to the question 
ben knew that mundon had placed the gold in a box underneath his bunk 
there was so little of it as yet that this had been thought to be asufficiently safe place 
should he awaken mundon 
it hardly seemed necessary 
he crept from hisbed and crossed the room to the door 
the stealthy footsteps could beheard at intervals as though the person constantly paused to listen 
the noise appeared to come from the corner of the building in which the jigger was situated and ben concluded that the man was searchingthere for the gold 
feeling that he could keep quiet no longer bengrasped mundon s arm 
 hush he whispered 
 don t speak 
some one s out there--looking forthe gold mundon was thoroughly awake in an instant 
together they crept to thedoor 
the noise suddenly ceased and there followed a long interval ofsilence 
 i m afraid we ve frightened him off whispered mundon 
just then a slight sound told them that the burglar was still there 
aflash of light through the cracks of the door told them that he carrieda dark lantern 
 be ready mundon directed 
 i ll unlock the door and we ll rush forthe gates he unlocked the door and the partners tore across the rough floor tothe gates 
they were somewhat surprised to find them locked 
 who s there 
stop or i ll fire cried ben 
they listened trying to locate the intruder in the darkness but thesilence following this challenge remained unbroken 
 he must hev run up the beach to climb the bulkhead said mundon 
 i ll go out and head him off 
you stay here and watch 
if he s hidin here and makes a sound you call me left alone in the darkness ben fancied several times that he heardthe burglar moving in the black shadows of the interior 
but a carefulinvestigation with the aid of a lantern when mundon returned provedthat the place was empty 
 i don t see how he could hev got over that bulkhead so quick mundonremarked as he related his unsuccessful attempt to capture the man 
 must hev ben mighty lively and an acrobat in the bargain to git outof sight in that time 
let s see what mischief he s ben up to the jigger was undisturbed but they found footprints in the moistground near the furnace 
 mebbe he came in a boat mundon suddenly suggested 
 mebbe he wasn tafter our gold at all ben stared in surprise 
 not after the gold he exclaimed 
 then whatin thunder was he after  can t you guess  no  well i was thinkin that mebbe there s more opium hidden away herethat we ain t found  opium  well we found one lot here 
why shouldn t we find some more 
who s tosay that we found all there was stowed here  they would have taken it away before this  how could they 
they didn t dare come back while there was a chance ofthem custom house fellers bein round 
and lately we haven t let thisplace out our sight  that s so replied ben 
 you think there s more opium hiddensomewhere round this furnace  that s it  well i ll take out those loose bricks in the morning--those on theside next the water that we didn t touch in the morning a thorough search was made but no opium was found 
no satisfactory explanation of the presence of the midnight visitoroffered itself but matters of greater importance soon occupied thethoughts of the partners 
news of the venture spread 
the scoop was read by thousands and manyof the curiously inclined were attracted to the spot 
on the second day the crowd was so large that ben was compelledto close the gates 
there were several reporters who took notes photographed ben and the interior of the building and interviewed thepartners as to their enterprise 
although ben was feeling better he was not entirely at ease 
the wholething seemed so theatrical 
it was like working on the stage of atheater 
besides he was not yet assured of success 
while the presence of spectators was flattering it was ratherembarrassing to the workmen 
they would have preferred to have madetheir clean-up without an audience 
skepticism along with curiosity was written on the faces of all 
and like all sensation-seekers theywithheld any decided opinion until the result should be known 
in imagination ben could already hear the jeering laughter of the crowdover his failure and this added to his nervousness 
his cheeks wereflushed with excitement and he stole over to where beth and little suewere standing and said in an anxious whisper it s just awful not toknow how it s going to pan out when at length the crucial moment arrived and he saw mundon scoop upsome particles of yellow metal with one hand while with the other hewaved his hat everything seemed to swim before ben s eyes 
the crowd gave a hearty cheer in which he joined as if in a dream 
it was pleasant to be congratulated and it must be confessed that theboy miner enjoyed being looked upon as a marvel of enterprise 
old madge appeared to be wonderfully interested in the proceedings andben did not quite like the expression of his countenance when he lookedupon the gold 
neither did he like a look of envy which could be seenupon the faces of some others 
 can t please everybody ben said to himself with a shrug 
 somepeople never like to see any one else succeed the rest of it was pleasant enough 
there was a sort of fourth-of-julyexcitement about it that was most exhilarating 
after the last hanger-on had gone and the gates were shut for thenight mundon remarked that he would go down-town to get a new fittingthat was needed 
 we got twice as much gold to-day as we did yesterday he said as heturned to go 
 mebbe we ll get twice as much as this to-morrer--it sbound to vary 
but anyway we re all right 
well so long 
i ll beback inside of an hour  so long ben replied 
left alone on the scene of his triumph ben surveyed the mass ofrubbish and endeavored to estimate how much it would yield 
he had supposed himself to be alone and was surprised to see achinaman standing in the opening above the little strip of beach 
 what do you want here ben demanded 
 i come to see you on business the man replied in excellent english 
 how d you get here  o i come in when other people come and i wait till your partner go because i want to see you alone with a quick motion of his arm the man threw back one of his voluminoussleeves and pointed with his claw-like fingers to the roof and walls 
ben noted that his dress marked him as a member of the ordinarymerchant class of chinese 
 you work with the bricks and dirt he said pointing to the piles ofrubbish 
 what you intend to do with building ben s suspicions were aroused 
 he wants to drive some bargain with meabout that opium business he thought 
 o i ll sell it for lumber to some builder i guess he indifferentlyreplied 
 not worth very much  no not very much  i notice you have plenty of room here so i think perhaps you liketo rent this place to me to store my goods he darted one of hiscapacious sleeves inside his blouse and drew forth a card which hehanded to ben 
 i give you my card ben glanced at the card 
 ng quong lee fruitpacker factory jackson street it read 
 i shall be here for only a short time ben said 
 the lease of thisbuilding expires in a few months 
besides you couldn t store anythinghere there are too many holes in the walls and roofs  o that wouldn t matter --my goods are canned 
my factory too crowdedat this time of year 
fruit season now you know 
for a few months ilike to rent another place  i m sorry i can t accommodate you ben said turning away but ineed all the place myself  i give you thirty dollars a month the chinese said with a shrewdglance 
this offer increased ben s suspicion and he flatly refused to considerit 
 you make too much money the other said in conclusion 
 you too rich i think 
well i leave my card 
perhaps some time you come to see me 
some time he looked ben squarely in the face if mr 
fish make youtrouble you come to see me with which enigmatical remark he politelybowed and took his departure 
 i wonder what he was after and what he meant by that last benreflected when he had fastened the gates after his strange visitor 
 there s something wrong about it or he wouldn t offer me thirtydollars a month for a part of this crazy old shed 
he ll wait a longtime i m thinking before he receives a call from me after thinking the matter over ben concluded not to mention it tomundon 
he was afraid he might urge him to accept it and this he didnot wish to do 
chapter xwork stoppedthe next morning ben saw a picture of himself above the title our boyminer in one of the daily papers 
he felt the sensationalism of it but he could not deny that it pleased him 
 publicity was the penalty one had to pay for being prominent he toldhimself 
and the thought pulled him very erect like a balloon tuggingat his neckband 
he was elated with success 
all doubts which he had previously feltabout speculation being a hazardous way of making money vanished likemists before the sun 
the warnings he had heard all his life from thewiseacres about the slow way being the sure way he now felt to be allnonsense 
indeed so egotistical is success that he even wonderedthat he could ever have felt any doubts

 our boy miner  after i ve made my fortune i ll be old-fogyish and save the cents he reflected 
 this mining venture is quite as sure a way of makingmoney as clerking in a store--and much more rapid his attention wasattracted by something mundon was saying to a reporter who was making a story of their experience 
 o taint no trouble to show you our operations mundon remarked  no trouble at all 
if twas a real mine underground that d be anotherthing 
folks was so curious bout a mine i once had up in placer countythat i trained a dog i had to show em round 
i d fasten a candle toa strap that went round his forehead and he d take em all over thatmine 
got so knowin at last that when he d pass any rich ore he dstop and bark 
sure he added as the hearer s smile proclaimed hisincredulity you kin put that in your paper and i ll vouch for it  i wish mundon wouldn t yarn it so ben said to himself 
 and i wishall these folks would go home before we make the clean-up he drewmundon aside 
 can t you get rid of them before we melt the stuff  don t know 
they pear to be powerful interested in what we re doin the other replied 
 that s just it they re too much interested 
we ve got gold on bothdays but there s no knowing how long that luck will last 
suppose weopened the crucible some night and didn t get anything  well twouldn t kill us if we didn t--just once  just think what they d say mundon smiled 
 what do we care what they say he sturdily asserted 
 i tell you ben i wouldn t be a bit sorry if it got noised roundthat we weren t makin such a bloomin lot  why  well it d keep folks from gettin envious for one thing the result of the day s work did not greatly vary from those of theother two 
about the same small quantity of gold-sponge remained in thecrucible and the crowd seemed slightly disappointed 
 that little bit wouldn t make anybody very envious remarked ben 
 infact i doubt if most people would work as hard as we have for it  you think it wouldn t but you don t know much bout envy and youdon t know men 
this is the stuff mundon said as he carefully tookthe gold from the crucible be it much or little of it that makeswild beasts of men 
 most all the sins that make a man into a beast canbe laid to this pretty shinin dirt on the afternoon of the fourth day ben and mundon were working likebeavers 
 bout five minutes now and we ll take out the amalgam mundonremarked 
 i b lieve it ll carry more than twice as much asyesterday s 
somehow the stuff shined more when we broke it up 
ireckon i ve got bout a quarter of the chimney chipped  that s slick said ben 
 when do you think we d better tackle theground  o that ll keep till we re through with the chimney 
you see a gooddeal works through the cracks now and we kin make a thorough clean-upafterwards 
i b lieve there s lots of copper as well as gold and silverin that slag under the old wharf  you do  i m most as certain of it as i am of the chimney 
if we make as muchas the opium brought i s pose you ll be satisfied  that would be good enough  queer them smuggler fellers never showed up ain t it 
the more ithink of it the more certain i am that that was what the burglar wasafter  but we couldn t find any traces of the drug  mebbe he got it before we run out 
well most likely some one of thosegovernment chaps warned em not to come here while the watch was bein kept up 
there s gen rally some one gits wind of such a plan in timeto make fools of the rest 
i s pose the temptation to be tricky is toomuch for em  yes 
and i suppose there are many temptations to a man in such aposition  bless you 
i guess there is 
there s lots of men who d be squareenough if they was let alone but put em in a place where there s achance to cheat and some one to show em the way and they don t needno coaxin 
did you suspicion any of em in partic lar  well ben hesitated it s an awful mean thing to say about a manwhen you ve got no proof --he dropped his voice -- but you know ididn t like the man who was put in charge of the case  what s his name  cutter 
i couldn t help feeling that he wasn t straight 
he didn tseem sincere  he wasn t round here at all was he  no 
but there wasn t any need of his coming 
he just stays in theoffice and directs others 
how easily he could warn the men who stowedaway the stuff here not to come after it  they made me mad with their suspicions mundon exclaimed 
 ishould think that sperience would have taught em to suspect oneof theirselves sooner than us 
 twas only one man as showed anysuspicions outright and like as not he was one of the rogues himself 
i was half a mind to tell him so once but i knowed twouldn t do nogood  not a bit ben agreed and it might do harm  mining s a curious business 
it s the only business on earth though where you ain t cuttin the ground away from under some other man sfeet 
you re just a-gettin somethin that everybody wants and needs and consequently everybody s glad you re gettin it 
it s a gamble and that s why it s so thunderin fascinatin 
there s one drawback though it makes a man distrustful of his kind --i s pose cause it sso mighty easy to get fooled 
an old miner doesn t b lieve in any onebut just himself--from principle 
it s astonishin how completely hekin pin his faith to rocks and how he balks when it comes to tryin it on human nature  father wasn t much so remarked ben but he was an exception isuppose  he wasn t rich was he  no although he often thought he was 
his riches never came nearenough to capture  that s it you see 
but you take an old miner who s made his fortunes and lost em through havin salted mines worked off on him --if heain t the scariest bird ever seen 
talk about saltin a bird s tail 
why he wouldn t trust his own twin brother  well there s no danger of ours being salted  no cause twasn t thought to be a mine 
i ve seen some queer tricksplayed in that line 
once i knew a man who went to look at a mine 
hesaw the samples taken from all over the mine put em in canvas bagshimself and never took his eyes off these bags till they was sealedup with his private seal 
just as the rest of the party was gettin into the stage to leave the man who was a-thinkin of buyin the minehad a kind of a feelin that he d ben fooled 
he couldn t explain itnohow but he just had that feelin 
so he wouldn t get on that stage but he went all over the mine a second time and took another set ofsamples 
well the assays told the story 
the first set went more n ahundred dollars to the ton and the last set went less n a dollar  how did they break the seals  they didn t break em 
they salted the bags after he sealed em bysqueezin a quill toothpick through the canvas and blowin gold-dustinto em 
i don t wonder that---- mundon was interrupted by a pounding on the gates 
 i ll go said ben 
when he had unfastened the gates two men walked into the yard 
thefirst handed ben a paper 
 what does this mean ben wonderingly asked 
he did not at firstcomprehend the meaning of the proceeding but his eye caught the word injunction and he knew that meant stop  it s an injunction served upon you the man replied 
 are you an officer  i am  what ground-- ben stopped for he felt his voice tremble 
 it s to compel you to stop working another man s property  but i bought the right to work it--from the owner ben cried 
 that he did mundon spoke up stoutly and i signed as a witness  where is the owner 
where is old madge 
i ve got his signature to thepaper 
he can t go back on that the boy exclaimed 
 he s done thisfrom spite because i refused to take him into partnership  don t get excited the officer said 
 mr 
madge has nothing to dowith this there was an angry light in ben s eyes 
 well who has then he defiantly inquired 
 i have the other man replied 
he had not spoken before and he seemed to enjoy the boy s distress 
he was a small man shabbily dressed and there was nothing about hisappearance to indicate that he could be possessed of wealth 
he paused after those two words and appeared to relish prolonging thesuspense 
ben turned upon him 
 what have you got to do with it he asked 
 i happen to be the owner of the land--and improvements  but you leased it and the lease does not expire until next november 
the improvements belong to the man who leased the land and put them onit  the lease expired a month ago  that is false ben s indignation was so great that he could hardlyspeak 
 mr 
madge told us that the lease ran for thirty-five years andcommenced in november  that was the date on which the building was commenced the lease datedfrom four months earlier ben turned to mundon sick at heart 
 can t you remember what he saidwhen i filled in the dates  he said the first pile for the buildin was drove in november but he meant fur us to think that were the date of the lease too 
 pears like we ve ben taken in ben  the building belongs to me and the rubbish that s here 
i ve paid forit fairly and squarely and it s only right that i should be allowedto work here until november 
i bought the right to do it  we re not talking about any rights now young man except those thelaw allows the owner remarked with a dryness that was irritating 
 you can t trespass on another man s property to work anything heturned to mundon who was bending over the jigger stop that 
that smine he cried 
mundon straightened himself 
in his hand he held a wide-mouthed bottlepartly filled with amalgam 
 no it ain t he replied 
 it b longs to this young man 
he d justabout finished with his day s work when you came in --and it b longs tohim  i ve got the law on my side 
he can t take anything off thisproperty--my property-- now  well then responded mundon setting the bottle on the floor of the jigger neither kin you 
if you touch this stuff before this thing ssettled i ll have the law on you the two men looked at each other for a moment 
then mundon drew ben aside 
 tain t no use talkin to him 
iknow him--his name s fish and he s a reg lar old shark 
rich asanythin --owns piles of tenements and grinds his tenants down ter theirmarrer bones 
i saw him nosin round here on the day we made our firstclean-up 
the question is what are you goin to do  o i don t know ben cried in despair 
the two strangers were leisurely surveying the arastra and its contents 
 know any lawyer mundon asked 
 no a recollection of mr hale who had been in the collector s office onthe day of his visit flashed before him 
he believed him to be thegreat lawyer of whom he had heard 
he had appeared interested in theventure if skeptical and since then the scheme had proved a success 
ben was thinking very hard 
 cause if you do mundon continued he might find some hole fur usto crawl out of this view of the situation was humiliating but ben was forced toaccept it 
 stay here and watch things while i go down town and see what can bedone he answered 
he was angrier than he had ever been in his life 
the injustice of being made a victim of fraud seemed to sear his spiritlike hot iron 
to be tricked cheated and have no redress was such amonstrous wrong 
 to think he said to himself on his way down-town how i resistedthe temptation not to tell old madge my whole plan 
this is the rewardi get for being too conscientious 
i ought not to have told a soul bitter thoughts crowded fast upon him as he hurried along 
herecalled a conversation he had once heard between two young men 
one had said that there was not a rich man living who had acquiredhis wealth--unless it had been inherited--honestly and with a clearconscience 
ben had been impressed with this statement and had repeatedit to his father who had denounced it as false 
 there are plenty ofknaves among rich men but there are honest men too his father hadsaid 
 it must have been a poor man envious of the wealth of otherswho said that thing still ben reflected that his father had been a poor man credulous trusting in all men to his own disadvantage sometimes 
 in order to get on in the world was it necessary to deceive andcheat the boy questioned 
 no it isn t true he exclaimed aloud causing the passers-by to regard him curiously 
 i d rather be inmy place and know that i ve done the square thing than be in his 
iwouldn t stain my immortal soul for gold sustained by this thought he found courage to make his appeal 
mr hale was in his office and in a few words ben told him what hadhappened 
 so you ve come to grief already my boy the lawyer said 
 well let s see what can be done he asked ben a few questions and dispatched a messenger to the cityhall to search for the recording of the lease 
 now go home and wait he said in conclusion 
 and don t worry aboutit any more than you can help  thank you 
about paying you mr hale -- ben began but the otherinterrupted him 
 never mind about that 
i don t expect any pay 
i sometimes do thingsfor pure love of humanity 
queer way to do business isn t it 
but imade my own way in the world boy and i know what it is 
why when ifirst went in for law it was like climbing a greased pole backwards ben left the office with a lighter heart as indeed did most people 
like them too he had a conviction that the lawyer would find a wayout of the dilemma 
mr hale had told ben that he had no right to occupy or work theproperty while the injunction was pending so he hastened back toconsult with mundon as to the best course to be pursued 
he found the latter disconsolately sitting upon the fence 
the mule wastied to a post alongside and the pair presented a sorry appearance 
the men had departed mundon said after nailing up the gates 
the partners agreed to take turns in keeping guard over the premisesuntil the result of mr hale s search was known and it was decidedthat ben should take the first night 
 it s exasperating not to know how much there is in the amalgam 
in alljustice it s mine said ben with flashing eyes 
 and i intend towatch it --and fight for it too if need be  you ve got to fight such mean sneaks with one weapon--and onlyone--and that s the law remarked mundon carefully whittling a stickhe held 
 there ain t no other way you kin git the best of em hepointed up the hillside 
 there s your cousin now 
she s ben down hereaskin after you  come out on the point for a while ben said beth 
 it will rest you with a grave face he joined her and they slowly walked along the beach 
chapter xia midnight fight i ve met one square man and that s mr hale ben said with emphasis after he had told her about his trouble 
 then you don t think mundon s square ben stopped and faced her 
 what have you heard he asked 
 they say that he was in with the smugglers and led you to discovertheir opium so that you d get the reward --and then he d cheat you outof it  what nonsense 
how could he  o i don t know --somehow  i suppose mr hodges and his wife started that 
what more did theysay he stooped and picked up a smooth bit of driftwood which he flungfar out into the water 
 i don t care that for their opinion  they say that you ll never get your money back that mr 
fish is themeanest man in town that he won t give you any show at all and won tlet you take another cent out of the works  then they ve heard about it already he asked 
she nodded 
 quickwork 
and that it serves me right 
i dare say that s another thing theysay the girl s face flushed 
 yes they did 
mrs hodges was the worst 
shesaid that mundon was a sharper and that you were a greeny  well it isn t over yet they walked on for a few moments in silence 
although ben spoke upstoutly he was very despondent 
 tell you what i wish you d do beth he suddenly said 
 i m going towatch to-night at the works and if you should hear me blow a whistle do you blow hodges as loud as you can 
three times you know 
does hestill keep one at the house  yes 
ever since he had that trouble about the land it has hung behindthe kitchen door 
i can easily take it up to my room  all right 
your house is so near that you d be sure to hear me 
thegates are nailed up but i can t help feeling a little nervous 
keepwhat i ve told you to yourself  do you think you will lose it all ben  i can t tell 
i m going to make a fight for it  you re awfully worried 
i can tell by your face  well what if i am 
most men are--most of the time 
it s life bethsighed 
 we re rushed along just as if we were on a river and all wecan do is to do the best we can 
if we do that it s enough he stopped and ground the heel of his shoe in the damp sand 
 i heard aman describe it oddly once 
he likened life to a dog-pit 
he called itan arena but he meant a dog-pit 
and he said a man had to take holdwith a bulldog s grip to succeed 
i thought it was horrible then butsomehow it comes back to me now  i never saw you in fighting mood before  haven t i had enough to make me so 
to have that rich old miser takewhat belongs to me 
it s mine and he knows it and so does everybodyelse 
and if he sneaks through this hole he s found in the lease andtakes my gold he s just as much a thief as if he d broken into myhouse and stolen what didn t belong to him 
i don t care if the lawdoes back him up --it s dishonest trickery  maybe you won t be a millionaire after all the girl s face worea blank expression 
then she suddenly brightened 
 but millionairesalways go through this sort of thing don t they 
mr palmer landed insan francisco with only fifty cents in his pocket and chopped wood toearn his dinner 
i ve heard him tell about it lots of times 
i thinkhe d rather talk about it than anything else in the world 
perhaps she glanced at ben you re too well dressed ben to turn out amillionaire 
perhaps you ought to go barefooted or at least wearragged shoes first her companion smiled 
 girls are always thinking of appearances he said 
 but i think you had better give up the hope of my being amillionaire that s a fairy tale 
if i make a few thousand out ofthis --provided i can beat this old devil-fish --i ll be satisfied  i d set my heart on a million she replied but if you re satisfied i ought to be 
you think girls are funny to be always thinking oflooks 
how can we help it 
we re never really in anything we haveto stand one side and see the boys do things  fighting for instance ben remarked 
they had retraced their steps and were again at the entrance of theworks 
mundon still sat on the fence thoughtfully gazing at the nailedgates 
the mule was wistfully looking at them too with an injuredair as indeed was quite fitting in a tenant who had been evicted 
 good-night said ben 
 don t forget  i won t beth replied 
then she added in an undertone don t tellhim --she indicated mundon -- that i m going to listen she turnedquickly away before ben had time to reply 
through the long hours of the night as ben sat in the shadow ofa wall across the street from the works he had plenty of timefor reflection 
although he had indignantly refused to believe theimputation against mundon s honesty still it kept persistentlyrecurring to him 
 can it be possible that he was in with that smuggling gang and thatfear of personal safety made him use me as a catspaw to inform onthem he asked himself but dismissed this as being highly improbable 
mundon s surprise when the opium was discovered had been too genuine tobe doubted 
besides had he been a party to the smuggling by exposing it hewould have put an end to the business in the future as far as he wasconcerned 
the custom house authorities had held a theory that he hadbeen one of the ring from the fact that no one came to remove theopium 
as an offset to this mundon maintained that one or more of thegovernment employees must have been in with the smugglers and warnedthem 
it was a block-puzzle the pieces of which ben placed in manydifferent positions as the night wore on 
how long that night seemed to him 
his brain was too excited to permitsleep to trouble him and his position harassed him 
about two o clock in the morning he saw a figure stealing along in theshadow of the building 
the moon was shining and ben could see thatthe man stopped and looked around as if to make sure that he was notobserved 
 he s going to climb up and drop through that hole in the roof bensaid to himself 
 that s the way he got in before 
i ve got the burglarat last the figure paused as if to listen and then cautiously climbed up therough side of the building and disappeared through the hole in the roof 
ben decided to go around the building and enter through the openingon the water side 
he was obliged to climb the high bulkhead whichran out into the bay and then he swiftly ran along the beach 
peeringwithin he saw the man stooping over the jigger and searching for itscontents by the aid of a bull s-eye lantern 
he was of slight physique and there was something about the figure that was strangely familiar 
just then the man raised his head in a listening attitude and benrecognized him 
 syd he exclaimed 
 i always knew he was a mean sneak but i neverthought he d be a thief ben sprang toward him and grasped his arm 
 that s mine 
you arestealing my gold he cried 
the other tried to shake off his accuser 
 let go he screamed 
but ben did not relax his hold 
 not till you give me what you vestolen  i won t 
i ve as much right to what i find as you have syd doggedlyreplied and i m goin to keep what i ve got 
let go i say for answer ben flung himself upon him 
they were about equally matched and both fought desperately 
a misstepon the ground sent them sprawling among the broken bricks and rubbish 
ben was uppermost and soon would have vanquished his adversary whensomething flashed before his eyes and he felt the thrust of a knife inhis breast 
with his remaining strength he blew a blast on his police-whistle andthen a faintness overpowered him and he knew nothing more 
chapter xiiin the sickroomthe house in which beth lived was a dreary structure perched on thenorthern slope of the steep hill above the works 
a dispute commonin the settlement of property boundaries in california had arisen inregard to the land on which the house stood and in consequence it hadnever been painted nor the ground around it inclosed by a fence 
from the interior however one overlooked these deficiencies becauseof the gorgeous panorama of bay mountain and sky that was framed byevery window 
dame trot as ben called her was the wife of beth s stepfather forthe girl s own mother had died shortly after her second marriage 
thehome was not congenial to the young girl but as mr hodges had usedall the money which her mother had left she was compelled to remainunder his roof 
sydney chalmers was the son of the present mrs hodges by a formermarriage 
it was in mr hodges house that ben regained consciousness on themorning of the encounter at the works 
he was conscious of a severe pain in his head and a feeling of greatweakness 
some one was talking and gradually a dim realization came toben that he was the subject of the conversation 
he recognized the voice of mr hodges 
 he s been trying to mine the inside of the old smelting works andfish the owner served an injunction on him yesterday just as he wasgoing to get the clean-up for his day s work  that s a strange enterprise some one replied 
ben recognized thedoctor s voice 
 yes i m thinking he s throwing his money away 
 course he got alittle gold but in my opinion there ain t enough in the whole shebangto pay for the mule he s bought  then he put money into the scheme  every cent he had in the world went into it 
crazy 
might just aswell stand on the sea-wall and fling his dollars into the bay 
minechimneys 
don t you suppose if there was any gold in that chimney oldmadge who leased the property would have got it out years ago 
he sgot ben s two hundred dollars though that s what suits him betterthan mining soot he laughed at his poor witticism 
 don t talk about it now the doctor said 
 he ll come to presently ben opened his eyes to see the doctor bending over him 
 it s all right my boy he said 
 don t be frightened ben dimly wondered where he was 
the wound in his breast was painfuland he felt very weak 
he noticed that mr hodges was standing at the foot of the bed and hesurmised that he must have been carried to his house 
he closed hiseyes and tried to think over the events of the previous night 
 it wasn t much of a knife the doctor said or it would have donemore damage 
when you feel able to talk he kindly said to ben youcan tell us all about it the patient nodded and closed his eyes again 
everything seemedslipping from him 
 guess there ain t much to tell hodges said gruffly 
 it s prettycertain who done it ben s senses faintly rallied at this remark 
 could it be possible he thought that they did not know who hisassailant was he instantly surmised that hodges suspected mundon 
 syd must have made good his escape before they found me he mentallyconcluded 
 what a coward he lay with his eyes closed a great deal of the time and reviewed thesituation 
should he expose syd 
it was hard to keep from doing so whenhe thought of all he had suffered at his hands 
he had been such abrazen thief too so shameless in his villainy 
still by the ramifications of marriage he occupied the relation of abrother to beth at least she treated him as one and he lived underthe same roof with her 
besides his family had received ben in hishelpless state and were caring for him 
a sudden generosity pleaded with him not to expose the culprit 
itwas such a noble impulse so far above the standards to which hewas accustomed that he was almost ashamed to follow it and triedto belittle it by placing a value upon it 
he said to himselfhalf-contemptuously there wasn t more than thirty or forty dollarsin the amalgam anyway and that s a low price for a reputation 
whenhe finds out that i haven t told on him he can return the gold 
at anyrate i m going to give him a chance he resolved upon this course although it annoyed him that mundon should be suspected and he feltthat he must exonerate the latter 
 you said just now mr hodges that you were pretty certain who--whodid this to me  yes i did and i am emphatically replied mr hodges 
 it s that manmundon you ve been taken in by who s done it  you re all wrong ben answered 
 he had nothing to do with it  where was he then 
where is he now  he had to find a place for the mule then he went down-town to sleep 
of course he couldn t sleep in the room we built because the placedoesn t belong to us they say mr hodges looked the doubt he felt 
 let him give an account of himself first ben before you re too sureof his innocence  he ll come around just as soon as he hears of this ben closed hiseyes wearily but suddenly opened them again 
 there he is now 
i canhear his voice he cried as mundon appeared 
 well ben my boy how d this happen mundon s distress was toogenuine to be doubted 
 i saw a man taking the amalgam and i tried to stop him 
we got into afight over it and he scratched me a little that s all  all 
isn t it enough mundon indignantly cried 
 how white you are ben 
why you re almost faintin away now  no i m all right ben hastened to say 
 you don t look it 
what sort of a lookin man was he ben closed his eyes 
 i don t know 
it was dark you know  twas bright moonlight --and there s a lot shines through the holes inthe roof on a clear night 
ain t you got no idee what he looked like ben shook his head 
mundon reflected a moment 
 that s queer ben 
you don t tell us enoughabout the man for us to git hold of anything he said 
 i d like togit at him 
you had a tussle with him yet you don t say whether he wasfat or thin or tall or short 
we ain t got nothin ter go by ben smiled faintly 
 what s the use of going 
we couldn t afford tohire a detective it would cost more than the clean-up amounted to 
besides the fellow s got away by this time  you pear to take it mighty easy like 
might have killed you 
i d liketer give him a good drubbing on my own account said mundon 
hodges cast a lowering look from one to the other 
he was too stubbornto relinquish at once his theory that mundon was guilty yet the man sbearing and conversation were puzzling 
 he s the boldest chap that ever lived and ben s the greatest fool or else i m on the wrong tack he reflected 
 i b lieve i ll find outwhether he turned up at his hotel at three o clock in the morning ornot as soon as he heard the front door close upon mundon ben called out tolittle jim who hung around the bed in mute sympathy where s syd  he didn t sleep at home last night the boy replied 
mr hodges looked surprised and there was an awkward pause duringwhich ben thought best to close his eyes again 
 he said last night that he was goin to stay all night with tom miles  cause they was goin clammin early this mornin jim added 
 then why didn t you say so in the first place his father said ashe strode from the room 
ben s pale cheeks had grown quite pink 
 jim he said in a low voice will you do something for me  sure  well i wish you d find out where syd is and tell him i want to seehim 
you can tell him how i got hurt and that nobody knows who did it 
tell him that the doctor says i ll be all right in a few days  is there anything else you d like ben 
 cause if there is i ve gota dollar and fifty-five cents what i m a-savin up to buy a safety with and i d jest as soon take some of it as not  no thank you 
just do that one favor for me and it s all i ll ask jim departed and in an hour or so reported that sydney could not befound 
tom miles had expected to dig for clams but as sydney hadfailed to put in an appearance he had given it up 
inquiry at the storewhere sydney was employed developed the fact that he had not been seenthere since the evening before 
shortly afterwards beth and little sue paid ben a visit 
by a fewadroit questions ben saw that they had no suspicion of syd s part inthe night s work 
 if you d only made the thief give up the gold it would have been somesatisfaction beth said 
 yes that s so 
but this is only a scratch anyway  you ll have to be careful the doctor says  i mean to be but it frets me so to stay in bed that it does more harmthan good 
i want to see mr hale  yes and you want to find the robber  of course if i can ben wearily agreed 
 but i sha n t waste muchtime on him ben had plenty of time for reflection during his enforced stay in bed 
ever since the day of the injunction when mundon had mentioned thename of the owner of the land he had been haunted by the thought thathe had known or heard something of the man before but it was not untilthe second day after the robbery that it suddenly flashed upon him thathe was the man of whom the mysterious chinaman had spoken 
 fish he exclaimed and little jim who was hovering about his bed was for getting him some at once 
 i was only thinking aloud ben explained 
 i don t want any fish and added with a grim smile i ve had enough of that article already at which jim looked thoroughly puzzled 
 what possible connection could there have been between a band ofchinese smugglers and mr 
fish the wealthy miser ben asked himself 
 he was there on that first day so mundon said and the chinaman mayhave overheard something of his plans 
i ll fight him--see if i don t when i get out of this his impatience to be able to investigate the affair increased hourly 
he must see the chinese and find out what he had meant by his strangewarning 
as he had not told mundon about the chinaman s offer he decidednot to tell him of his resolve to visit him 
aside from his formersuspicions a love of adventure made him anxious to undertake the thingalone 
he was forced to wait a week before he was well enough to leave thehouse 
during this time sydney had not been heard from 
his motherwould not permit a public announcement to be made of his disappearance claiming that it was probable that he had met a cousin from san joseand had gone to that city for a visit 
whether she had any suspicion ofthe truth or not ben could not determine but she put an end to allopen speculation on the part of the family as to the whereabouts of theabsent one by emphatically declaring syd s old enough to take careof himself 
he s my flesh and blood and so long as i don t fret abouthim i don t see as any one else needs to chapter xiiithe opium raidalthough ben had been eager to go in search of his strange informer yet when he set forth he almost regretted not having brought acompanion 
he knew that the address given must be in the heart of thechinese quarter and like most san francisco boys he knew somethingof that dangerous locality 
he had heard of the mysterious murderswhich at times were of almost daily occurrence of the sick thrustinto the street to die and of the opium dens where white people werehidden 
he had heard too of the fierce dogs which were kept on theroofs of the houses of secret passages leading from house to house until the place was a vast honeycomb of runways through which thechinese slipped like rats in their holes 
chinatown may present a peaceful appearance in the daytime but atnight with the weird effects caused by the many-colored lanterns theinky recesses of the doorways the depths of underground burrows trodby velvet-footed shadows it is transformed into a region to striketerror to the bravest 
perhaps a thought of these dangers induced ben to choose broad daylightfor his quest 
he found the address easily enough--a house of severalstories that in some earlier period of the city had been an imposingresidence but was now used by the chinese for a fruit-canning factory 
the casing of the door was plastered with gaudy bills covered withchinese characters and through the broken window-panes could be seencountless piles of cans 
a short flight of steps led downward from the sidewalk to a basemententrance and as ben approached he saw a chinese leaning against theiron balustrade 
he recognized ng quong with a feeling of relief thathe should not be obliged to enter the house 
 illustration photo by arnold genthe 
 as ben approached he saw ng quong leaning against the ironbalustrade in this he was mistaken for the man would not talk upon the publicstreet where the very gutters might have ears 
he conducted ben through several corridors and stairways to an upperroom where a number of chinese were seated at a repast of rice andtea 
ben did not like to broach the object of his visit before such anaudience and waited until the meal was finished and the others haddeparted 
 you wish to rent part of your house his host blandly inquired 
 i haven t any house to rent at present ben replied 
 i want to findout what you mean when you say mr 
fish make me plenty trouble--yousabe the language used by the man was a rebuke 
 ah that man make you trouble already  yes trouble enough 
come tell me what you know about him  for what object should i tell you 
perhaps it might make me trouble  you say when i have trouble come and see you 
i have trouble --i come 
you tell me what you know --i give you ten dollars the chinese regarded him with a sphinx-like stare 
 o ten dollars isnot much money to me he remarked indifferently 
 i like to rent fromyou that s all 
on that day i speak to you i go with the crowd to seewhat you do 
i hear mr 
fish talk to old man  old man with a big gray hat and a cane ben eagerly inquired 
 yes 
i suppose those men think i not understand much english for theynot pay much attention to me 
mr 
fish say to old man that it too badto lose so much money 
they mean your gold--they watch it 
then theytalk about a lease and old man say it not good any more 
mr 
fish sayhe will fix book at city hall then stop you and work for gold himself 
he say he will give the old man some  i can t understand said ben why if the lease has expired heshould need to fix the record 
did he say anything else  no that s all i hear  well that s helped me some perhaps 
here s your ten dollars ben paid him the money with some regret 
it seemed a good deal for theinformation still it might be a clue to ravel the tangle 
suddenly there was a loud knock at the door followed by a noisypounding 
ben had not noticed that the door had been locked after him and he turned to ng quong in surprise 
the chinese did not respond to the summons but hurried with an ashenface through the inner door which he closed and locked behind him 
benheard some heavy bolts shot into place and realized that he was in avery unpleasant position 
the pounding increased and he saw that the door could not withstandthe assault much longer 
alone in a locked room into which the policewere forcing an entrance 
suddenly it flashed into his head that hisvisit to the house might have been noticed that his connection withthe opium found at the works might have strengthened the suspicions ofthe police and caused the raid 
if this were the case he knew it wasbetter for him to have remained where he was than to have followed thechinaman even if he had been given the opportunity 
in a few momentsthe door gave way with a crash and two policemen and several customsofficials burst into the room 
ben recognized one of the men who hadbeen stationed to watch the works 
 o it s you is it the man triumphantly exclaimed 
 they thought youwere too innocent-looking to be in with the gang but i knew better allthe time 
we ve caught you now  caught me ben indignantly repeated 
 at what i d like to know 
i came here to get some information from the proprietor of thisfruit-canning factory  information 
fruit factory the man sneered 
 that s a likely story 
this place has been under suspicion for some time as being one of thebiggest opium-dens and smuggler s storehouses in town during this conversation the other men had turned everything in theroom topsy-turvy 
they found nothing to reward their search in thefront room and turned their attention to the door which led to theinner room 
it took some little time to demolish this and when atlength they gained entrance not a chinese was to be found 
one inmatethey dragged forth from one of the rooms but as there was no evidenceagainst him no charge could be preferred 
ben took him by the arm 
 come home syd he said 
 it s all right --ihaven t told a soul they pushed their way through the curious crowd which had invaded thehouse 
when they were quite away from the neighborhood sydney brokedown 
 you re mighty good to me ben --i don t deserve it  it s nothing at all ben replied 
 isn t your good name worth alittle forbearance from one who s known you all your life 
how d youcome to be in that place he sharply questioned 
 i didn t know where else to hide 
i was afraid i d killed you and igot ng quong to let me stay there and make out some bills and accountsfor him  then you ve earned your keep--honestly syd looked him squarely in the face 
 yes he said 
ben gave a sigh of relief 
 it might have made a fuss he remarked 
 why --did they try to find me  no because your mother said she felt sure you had gone to san jose  to san jose syd repeated in surprise 
after a pause he added  mothers are queer--sometimes ben did not reply for he knew that syd thought that his mothersuspected the truth 
 i meant to venture out to-night to try to find out how you were andgive you your gold syd continued 
 here it is he held out the vial 
 i hope i ll never pass such a week of torture again  it has been a mean experience for us both ben replied as he tookthe vial but maybe it s done us both good 
i ll keep a nugget or alump out of this he held up the vial containing the amalgam for thescarf-pin i promised you once  no thank you ben i d rather not take it syd replied 
 just as you say ben put out his hand for they had reached the footof the hill 
syd took the proffered hand with such a hearty grasp thatben felt that the experience had made them better friends than they hadever been 
 that s over i m thankful to say said ben to himself as he rapidlywalked down the street 
 and now for mr hale chapter xiva crime discoveredmr hale was in his office when ben reached there but the latterconcluded that he would hear the result of the lawyer s investigationfirst reserving his bit of information until afterwards 
 well my boy said mr hale whirling around in his chair i m sorrynot to have better news for you a kind light shone in his eyes 
 we ve got a hard old customer to deal with i m afraid 
i ve had therecords searched and the entries of the lease were found to have beenduly and properly made he tilted back in his revolving chair and putthe tips of his fingers together 
 i don t see what we re going to doabout it 
we ve run up against a stone wall without apparently a cranny in it 
i say apparently because one never knows whatdevelopments may turn up 
it s a case of manifest injustice but suchcases are of daily occurrence  something has turned up ben said when mr hale had finished 
 ah so you ve got some news 
let s have it ben related his conversation with the chinese 
mr hale was astonished 
 i can scarcely believe that that old miserwould meddle with the records he exclaimed 
 it looks very like it 
yes--if what ng quong says is true fish is a grasping old shark but--what object could he have he mused 
 i ll tell you exclaimed ben 
 the lease is just as he says it is 
but there must have been some mistake in placing the dates on therecord and that mistake was in our favor  it may be so 
and the old fellow was so angered in being baffledafter he d made sure that the law was on his side --he was so angeredthat he went to the length of changing the figures  that sounds like the truth mr hale  i think you ve struck it ben but it s such an amazing thing that itseems incredible 
he s shrewd but he s overreached this time 
yes 
fora man of his means to tamper with the records for the sake of the moneyyou expect to make 
to what length will not money-grasping take a man  what are you going to do about it mr hale ben could not resistasking the question 
 i m going to have a microscopic examination made of the records andif what we think is so he shall pay dearly --he brought his fist downon the desk in front of him-- for his bad work 
i ve got several oldscores to his account that i d like to settle  how long will it take  to make the examination 
about five minutes  what a weapon it will be  exactly 
but you must cultivate patience when you have anything to dowith the law  do you think he s alone in the matter 
i mean do you think he did ithimself  no 
undoubtedly he hired some one to do it 
we must find his tool mr hale was as eager as a sportsman when he has caught sight of hisgame 
 we can get the grand jury after him--if it s true he gleefullyadded 
ben rose 
 then there is nothing to do at present but--  wait supplied mr hale smiling 
 come in to-morrow at this time 
imay have some news ben resolved not to tell mundon of the new developments in the caseuntil he knew the result of mr hale s investigation 
it was hardwork keeping the new hope to himself 
mundon was so depressed that benlonged to brighten him with the story of the day s events 
on the afternoon of the following day ben found himself impatientlyawaiting mr hale s return from court 
when he caught sight of the latter s beaming face he knew that theresult was favorable 
 it s all right my boy the lawyer exclaimed 
 it s just as wethought 
i ll have you mining again before you re many days older  the dates had been changed ben s voice was a little uncertain 
 yes--and a bad bungling job they made of it too 
i m surprised myclerk didn t notice it in the first place 
but of course he wasn tlooking for such sharp work as that 
by the way i told a reporter onthe gazette --you know they keep a man around the city hall on thelookout for news--who came to see what my expert was about  then it ll be in the papers  well i told him all he wanted to know 
you re not afraid of thepapers are you  no --i ve done nothing that i m ashamed of  exactly 
to-morrow morning mr fish s large circle of enemies willread with pleasure that he has been caught at last  there s another reason why i m glad the whole story s going intoprint  about that opium business  yes 
i think it will clear me from any suspicion of being connectedwith the ring 
i d like the real reason to be known for my being in ngquong s house  well twill be now ben went straight from the lawyer s office to mundon 
the latter waslooking more disconsolate than ever 
even the mule seemed to havecaught his state of abject misery 
 i ve just ben thinkin how i could get out of this old town mundonsaid 
 if i could manage to get to cripple creek i d be able to get onmy feet again ben did not reply and mundon glanced at his face 
 why ben you look as you d heard some good news  so i have partner mighty good news 
wo-o-w he flung his cap abovetheir heads 
 we re going to beat that muckery pair fish and madge sure s you re born  either you ve gone plumb crazy ben or else-- tell me bout it boy 
how d you down em during the recital of the story mundon gave ben a keen glance when hecame to the part relating to ng quong 
it was an awkward moment for both and ben regretted his silence atthe time the incident occurred 
 you forgot to mention the chinaman s visit at the time mundonremarked 
 but time ll tell ben and i ain t never ben afraid of time on the day following the investigation the gazette published thestory of the smelting works claim ben read the account aloud to mundon sitting on the fence outsidethe works 
of course in the tale ben was made a hero and mr 
fish adouble-dyed villain 
 they haven t got him black enough to suit me said mundon fiercelywhittling the stick he held 
 i hope they ll paint him blacker andblacker every day for a year there were two items of news in the article however that ben had notforeseen --the simultaneous disappearance of mr 
fish and one of theclerks in the city hall 
 now that there s no one here to stop us i d like to smash open thosegates and finish our work mundon shook his fist at the gates which glowered back at him 
 i veben turnin over in my mind all that there slag that s under the oldwharf 
i b lieve there s heaps of copper and lead buried there  no wonder you ve been depressed--with all that on your mind commented ben 
 i m to know to-day just how long it will be before theinjunction can be raised 
mr hale says this hard-luck story of ourswill hurry things--it s going to create sympathy for our case  well it oughter 
say ben just let me drop through that hole in theroof and do a little work on the quiet ben shook his head 
 twon tdo no harm 
you kin set here and watch  no mundon not for a million  how easy it is to talk about refusin a million--when you re young  this thing s going to be square on my part 
i ve made up my mind tostick to that ben answered 
 hello 
that boy looks like mr hale soffice boy he sprang down from the fence and tore open the envelope which the boygave him 
 hurrah 
mundon--we ve won ben cried 
 it s ours and you can smashthose gates as soon as you please mundon slid down from his perch and seizing a piece of scantling struck the old gates a mighty blow that started the nails from the wood 
 there he said 
 that does me good 
i ve wanted to smash em eversince those smarties came and nailed em up chapter xvben chooses a professionwithin the works they found everything with the exception of theamalgam which syd had taken exactly as they had left it 
mundon wasparticularly pleased to find the jigger undisturbed 
 here s the slag i mean ben 
i ve dreamt about that there identicallump fur three nights runnin mundon pointed to the rugged top of alava-like bowlder which reared itself from a corner of the earthenfloor 
 i guess you re right about the metals there are in it said ben butit might be an aerolite for all i know  what s that 
say it again  an aerolite 
it s the lump of metal they find when a meteor falls andit s unlike anything found on this earth  o a fallin star 
i knew a man who wrote some poetry about onethat fell in australia 
he called it stardust but i s pose ahard-as-nails professor would call it--by the name that you do whilespeaking mundon was surveying the ground 
 i ve got a scheme ben to grade all this stuff cordin to its value  how do mean  why we ve had sperience enough to see that d be the best way toeconomize our time and labor 
we ll assay it and grade it till we know bout where we stand  it ll be an awful lot of work to do it  yes it ll be tejus but it ll pay better in the end 
we ll--if yousay so ben course it s your own business but i m jest tellin youhow i d do if twere mine--we ll sep rate the stuff cordin to sizefirst and then cordin to value  it s a good plan 
don t defer to me any more--you idiot 
it makes mefeel so mean when you do it 
you know as well as i do that i don t knowthe first thing about this business  you re the boss ben mundon laconically replied 
 i don t doubt that the slag and muck and all the rest of it arevaluable said ben but the chimney--our golden chimney--is the thingwe re sure of now 
maybe the day s cleanup ll be more or maybe it llbe less but we know it ll be gold  you re right--we ve tested that and we re sure of it 
but we mustn tdespise the rest on that account 
now here s where the roasterstood--it must hev stood here cause it couldn t hev stood any placeelse 
well i m goin to sink a shaft here mundon stooped as hespoke and with his pocket-knife he dug a small hole from which heunearthed several small lumps of metal 
 just as i thought he said as he weighed them in his hand -- lead orethat ll assay heavy in silver  then there are those dumps --made when the furnaces were put in youthought 
we haven t touched those yet  you mean outside where the old fence stood  yes 
why just look here ben drew mundon outside the gates to wheresome mounds rose from the beach 
 it s my opinion that this boardthat s nailed on the fence here opposite these heaps was put here tomark them  they re heaps of waste most likely 
somethin s ben scratched intothe wood 
let s see what it is they carefully examined the board and ben deciphered the inscription  waste bullion  just think he cried that old madge has let this pile of stuffthat s one third solid silver maybe stay here all these years 
andmr 
fish close as he is too he added 
 it s awfully funny  it ain t funny that fish didn t do nothin with it cause he s thekind that just collects rents and forecloses mortgages 
he wouldn t putup a cent in any venture like this he d call it oncertain 
but oldmadge is a born miner 
well it is funny 
he ll be wild  there used to be a shed inside the old fence in a sort of an outsideyard ben remarked but they both fell down years ago  that so mundon replied as he stooped and carefully examined theground 
 yes here s the posts the shed rested on 
we ll excavate fiveor six feet deep here on the site of the old shed 
it s bound to payus fur our trouble  after it s been all these years on the open beach  what s that got to do with it 
nobody s ever mined here 
it stands toreason that they d hev stored more val able stuff in the shed than theywould in the open 
and there s the signboard a-tellin us that thesedumps are waste bullion during the weeks that followed their return to their claim the partnersworked industriously 
they sifted the result of their labors in threedumps graded according to value 
the first was coarse base bullion which assayed at two hundred dollars a ton 
one piece the largest weighed about twenty pounds the smallest pieces were the size of peas 
the second pile consisted of fine bullion its component particlesranging in size from a pea to a pinhead 
this assayed at one hundredand fifty dollars a ton 
a third pile averaged from seventy-fivedollars to one hundred dollars a ton 
the total product of this representing a week s work they estimated to be about seventeenhundred dollars 
the site of the old shed was excavated and water was brought to thespot in a flume for mundon thought best to wash the ground in a rockerbefore putting it through the jigger the result amply repaid them for their trouble 
 this beats me 
rockin on the beach of san francisco and makin ourtwo and three hundred dollars a day said mundon one day as they weredigging several feet below the surface 
 illustration rockin on the beach of san francisco and makin ourtwo and three hundred a day said mundon  it beats anything i ever heard of ben replied but i m willing itshould ben worked so hard during the day that he was too tired when night cameto do anything but go to bed as quickly as possible 
one sunday afternoon he paid a visit to beth 
he had not seen her forsome time and was anxious to know what progress she was making atschool 
she saw him coming and came running to meet him 
 will you walk out to the point ben  yes 
we don t do any work on sunday  well it s come true beth he said when they were well away from thehouse most of it has at any rate  o i m so glad  we re far enough along now to form a pretty correct figure of whatthere is in sight and we ve got four weeks more to work in  how much will you make  well how much do you guess  o i don t know the girl earnestly replied 
 you say it s come true and you must mean your fortune we used to talk about so i guess you renot disappointed 
everybody s so curious to know what you re making  they can keep on being curious 
i had enough of people s curiositybefore he grimly added 
 the work on the beach we have to do outside but we don t allow a soul inside the gates now  i know you don t and they say the reason is that you re not cleaningup anything and don t want any one to know it ben gave a dry laugh 
 or else we don t want any one to know how muchwe re making 
why wouldn t it work that way  it would said beth 
 do tell me ben i m just dying to know 
howmuch will it be  from ten to twelve thousand dollars  what 
you don t really mean it  indeed i do 
but you mustn t tell yet a while when they reached the house on their return mrs hodges awaited themin the doorway 
 found any nuggets ben she facetiously remarked 
 no he laughed 
 that yarn about finding them in chimneys was a fairytale i think 
but we ve found the stuff to make them out of whichanswers our purpose quite as well her husband looked over her shoulder 
 if the lease was never recorded or was done wrong ben couldn t fishoust you if he wanted to  i suppose he could strictly speaking ben replied 
 but you see heoverreached 
he played a mean dishonest trick in having a false entrymade in the record and now he doesn t dare to come back for fear ofbeing arrested  but he ll come back some time when the thing s blown over  well i ll be through with the works by that time ben remarked as hebade them good-night 
when the last day came it was with considerable regret that thepartners made preparations to leave the works forever 
 i don t want to stay one day longer than the time i m entitled to said ben 
 it s paid us well for our work but i wouldn t care to gothrough it all again  it has been sort of a worrisome job mundon replied 
 still it s bigpay 
seven thousand dollars for a boy like you to make in three months 
besides there s worry in all sorts of business and a man s jest gotto make the best out of it he philosophically added 
 do you know ben --now that it s all over i kin tell you --i know there was a timewhen you mistrusted me not exactly mistrusted either but you hadthe thoughts out of which mistrust is made 
o you needn t say youdidn t he exclaimed as ben made a gesture of dissent 
 i knew jest aswell as if you d told me so that you did 
i ain t a-holdin it up aginyou neither 
i know how many there was to put sech things into yourhead agin a stranger like i was  well i didn t let them stay there mundon 
i trusted you all through they heartily shook hands 
 i b lieve you did boy i b lieve you did 
it s ben a tough job though in places 
what with the smugglin business and your gettin cut and the injunction too 
but takin it all through jest lumpin it you don t regret it do you  no ben replied 
 we got through by the skin of our teeth inplaces he continued 
 it was a chance though that i didn t loseevery cent i had in the world 
it was just the merest accident thatthat chinaman overheard those two rascals and put us on their track 
besides we weren t dead sure--we couldn t be--that there was any goldin the old ramshackle works when i bought them 
it s too much likegambling to suit me 
i m not saying a word against your going intowhatever you want to but for myself i m going to choose somethingthat s slower and surer  made up your mind yet what it ll be  yes --i m going to berkeley --to college--to fit myself to be a miningengineer  that s the very best thing you can do  i m glad that you approve 
you see i ve got money enough to carry methrough and if i ve got brains enough too i m all right  goin to stick to minin --i see  yes mundon but with this difference i m going to equip myself tomine for others--i needn t mine for myself unless i choose to  end of the project gutenberg ebook the golden chimney updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions willbe renamed

 it seems to me said a philosopher once that there are no entirelygood men in the world and none completely bad 
single out your bestman and you will find that he lacks perfection in some part of him andexamine your worst and you will see that he has at least one redeemingquality in this book the men mostly verge towards bad but some are better thanothers 
because they are merely human they act according to theirlights 
you may meet others like them any day if you go out and about and most of them give extremely good dinners 
till they are foundout you consider them amusing afterwards being better than they you instantly set them down as most pernicious scoundrels and shakehands with yourself and write to your tailor to order more noticeablephylacteries on the next new suit 
this is called keeping up a healthymoral tone and does a great deal of good in the world

chapter i 
the antecedents of patrick onslow 
miss rivers picked out the name of patrick onslow in the society paperwhich lay upon her knee and drew idle circles round it with a pinkball-pencil 
fairfax tugged at his mustache and returned to the subjectwhich they had been discussing 
 the fellow has said fairfax a genial insolence of manner which seemsrather taking with some people 
but i confess i shouldn t have thoughthim the man you would have cared to see twice amy  you re prejudiced obviously and i ve a good mind to say maliciouslyprejudiced 
i don t know how much you saw of him because i can t beinvited to a wanderers club dinner you don t know how much i saw ofhim because you missed some distant train and didn t come here to theball last night 
but i ll tell you i saw all i could 
he s perfectlyand entirely charming 
he s been everywhere done everything and heisn t a bit blas  i heard said fairfax that mrs 
shelf was lionizing onslow round lastnight as the great traveler 
does he belong to the advertising varietyof globe-trotter 
did he sit in a side room and hold a small audiencespellbound with a selection from his adventures miss rivers shrugged her shoulders 
 not he 
but you know what mrs 
shelfis when she gets any show person at one of her functions 
the poor manhad to stand it for a while because she held on to him as though hemight have been her fan 
but he escaped as soon as he decently could bysaying he wanted to dance 
he asked me to give him the fourth waltz 
idid it out of sheer pity because i saw mrs shelf s thumbscrews weremaking him writhe  shows how little a man knows about the girl he s engaged to 
now i hadalways imagined that having the pick of the men you invariably wrotedown the best dancers and never saddled yourself with a stranger who wasa very possible duffer amy rivers laughed 
 that s generalizing 
but it was different lastnight because so to speak i m a member of the household here 
a wardcounts as a sort of niece doesn t she 
or between that and an adopteddaughter 
but anyway it was out of sheer pity for mr onslow in thefirst instance and it was with distinct qualms that i let him take medown to dance 
i quite intended after half a round to say the room wastoo crowded and go and sit somewhere 
that is to say i made up my mindto do this when he asked me 
however when i dropped my fingers on hisarm to go down-stairs i had my doubts 
you know after two seasons onegets instinctively to know by the first touch how a man will dance 
andwhen he put his arm around me and we moved to the music i felt likegoing on forever 
waltzing is hard just now because it s in a transitionstate between two styles but his dancing was something to dream about 
we started off with the newest quick waltz 
hamilton it was just lovely 
he was so perfect that just for experiment i altered my step by degrees you know 
automatically and without anything being seen he changed too and we were dancing the old slow glide before i knew 
and his steeringwas perfect 
in that whirling teeming tangled mob he never bumped meonce 
i gave him two more waltzes and cut another couple in his favor  which makes five in all said fairfax rather stiffly 
amy rivers took his hand and patted it 
 don t be cross dear 
you knowhow i love a good dance and one doesn t meet a partner like mr onslowevery day 
i suppose he s done his waltzing in vienna and paris andyorkshire and new orleans as well as here in london and by averagingthem all up he can t help but be good  is it from going to those places that mrs 
shelf called him the greattraveler  of course not 
hamilton how stupid you are about him 
why he srummaged about in every back corner of the world so they say  so they say yes 
teheran to timbuctoo 
but what does he say himselfabout his wanderings beyond the tram-lines 
shuffles mostly doesn t he 
and who s met him anywhere 
not a soul will come forward to speak 
itell you amy there s something uncanny about this patrick onslow 
heturns up here periodically in london after some vague exploring trip to aplace that isn t mapped and you can never pin him to tell exactly wherehe s been 
he comes with money spends it en prince and then goes offagain nominally perhaps to the gobi desert and returns with anothercargo  how romantic said miss rivers 
 yes isn t it said her fianc drily 
 if he d lived a centuryearlier one would have said he d got a sound business connection as apirate somewhere west indies way 
as this year is eighteen ninety-three and that explanation s barred one simply has to accept him as anuncomfortable mystery  hamilton how absurd you are 
wherever did all this rigmarole come from  from the club and london gossiping places generally 
i suppose we oughtto be indebted to onslow for providing us with something to talk about  but tell me if his antecedents are so queer how is it he goes aboutso much here 
he s apparently asked everywhere at least so mrs 
shelfsays and he knows everybody who s worth knowing fairfax laughed 
 why does london society take up with an ex-bushrangerfrom australia or a glorified advertising cowboy from the wild wildwest 
simply because london society is extremely parochial and getsdesperately bored with its own little self undiluted 
now onslow hasundoubtedly wandered about outside the parish and occasionally he letsdrop hints which make one think he s seen some queerish ups and downsin places where polite society doesn t go and in fact he preservesa good-humored reticence about most of his doings 
this makes peoplethoughtful and speculative 
if a chinese extradition warrant was to turnup to-morrow to arrest him for sticking up a three-button mandarinbeyond the great wall nobody would be a bit surprised or if he were totell the city this afternoon that he d a concession for a silver minein an unexplored part of venezuela which he wished to dispose of atreasonable rates we d take it with pleased equanimity 
now you know amy there s a fearful joy in entertaining a man of that stamp  especially when he s as fascinating as mr onslow can be when hechooses 
and such a waltzer 
but you speak as if he was a savage fromsome back settlement come into decent society for the first time 
heisn t that in the least 
he s a gentleman distinctly  my dear amy i never meant to suggest that he was not 
there s noparticular secret about his life 
he comes of a good west-county family was a harrow boy and played in their eleven went through cambridge and afterwards found a berth in the diplomatic service 
then by way ofvariety he got engaged to be married to a girl who jilted him on thestrength of which he began to run wild 
he started on six months leavefor a trip into tibet but he stayed beyond the limits of the postalsystem for two years and a half and when he got back to england thediplomatic corps found that they could get on very well without him 
sohe continued his rambles 
he doesn t seem able to settle down  that s because he can t forget the girl who threw him over exclaimedmiss rivers 
 how awfully romantic 
i wonder who she was 
she couldn thave been anybody nice or she wouldn t have done it because he s aregular dear 
and fancy his remembering her all this time 
i just lovehim for it  some fellows remarked fairfax judiciously would get jealous if thegirl they were going to marry talked about another man this way miss rivers reassured him first practically and then in words 
 yougoose said she if i cared for him in that way don t you see ishouldn t have spoken about him to you at all fairfax did not answer directly 
he kissed her thoughtfully and after awhile he said i m not superstitious dear as a general thing 
work ina shipping office tends to make one painfully matter of fact 
but for allthat i wish this fellow onslow would either marry or get crumpled up ina cab accident or have himself safely fastened down out of harm s waysomewhere 
i ve got a foreboding amy that he s going to do a bad turneither to you or to me which means both of us 
i know it s absurd but ican t get rid of it  how creepy said amy rivers 
 but what nonsense hamilton chapter iia fortune for the pair of us 
mr theodore shelf s carriage and pair drew up at the smartest house inpark lane and mr theodore shelf went up the steps and entered the doorwhich a man servant opened for him 
he was a stout middle-aged man with a clean-shaven face and a short frock-coat of black broadcloth 
he allowed himself to be eased of his hat and umbrella and thenpassed through the gorgeous hall to the rosewood billiard-room at theback 
there he found his guest mr patrick onslow in shirt-sleeves practising fancy shots by himself 
 what alone mr onslow  why yes 
i did have a hundred up with your niece earlier but some onecame for her  niece 
oh amy you mean miss rivers 
ah my dear sir 
from the love wehave for her in this household and the way we treat her you naturallyfancy she is a blood relation 
it is a graceful compliment for you topay mr onslow but it is my duty to correct you 
miss rivers is legallyonly my ward  ward 
oh see that 
red hard against the cushion and white bang overthe bottom pocket 
neat cannon wasn t it considering the long timesince i ve handled a cue  the only child of my late partner 
you know the firm still stands asmarmaduke rivers and shelf 
we call ourselves on the billheads agentsto the oceanic steam transport co though of course we really own thewhole line 
you see our flag sir in every sea  i know 
nagasaki to buenos ayres gin and gunpowder on the west coast coals and cotton at new orleans  and we do not send our steamers for the business of trade alone mr onslow 
we pick our captains and officers with an eye to a holierpurpose 
we trust that they spread a christian influence in all theirports of call observed mr 
shelf unctuously 
 yes i saw them at work once at axim on a tramp steamer you sent downthere 
they were taking krooboys on board 
the skipper received themon one of the bridge-deck ladders with a knuckleduster and kicked emalong 
the chief stood by with a monkey-wrench and tickled them with thatas they passed down to the lower deck aft 
they mentioned at the timethat this process had a fine christianizing influence prevented the boysfrom being uppish showed em what the white man could do when he liked taught em humility in fact 
i say there s a pull towards this bottompocket 
people have been sitting on the table  mr 
onslow mr 
onslow you are making a very serious accusation againstone of my ship s companies  accusations 
i 
never a bit of it 
the fellows only acted according totheir lights 
that s the only way sailormen know of getting krooboys towork and it was a case of squeezing the work out of them or having thenatural sack from you 
and so as they didn t know another method theyfell back on knuckleduster and monkey-wrench 
i ll play you fifty up mr 
shelf put up a large white hand 
 no i don t play billiards myself 
so many young men have been ruined by the pursuit that i refrain from itby way of setting an example 
but my friends who visit here are not soscrupulous and i have the table for them  beautiful said onslow 
he might have been referring to his own play or to mr shelf s improving sentiment 
 you see mr onslow from my position so many people look up to methat it is nothing short of my bounden duty to deprive myself of certainthings and be so far as possible a humble model for them to formthemselves by 
long before a constituency sent me to parliament idevoted my best energies to christianizing the lower classes and i hopenot without success 
if appreciation is any criterion i may say that iwas elected president of no less than twelve improvement societies 
ittook me much time and thought to attend to them 
yet i wish i could havegiven more  yes that pocket does pull there s a regular tram-line towards it 
h m mighty good work of yours 
but doesn t it sour on you sometimes 
don tyou want a day off occasionally 
a run down to monte carlo for instance  monte carlo 
you horrify me mr onslow 
you are my guest and i cannotspeak strongly but this is a very poor jest of yours  well perhaps you know best about that place 
monte carlo is risky atthe best of times for some folks because you re bound to meet crowds ofpeople you know and if they aren t on the razzle-dazzle too and pinnedto decent silence through their own iniquities some of them are aptto split when they get home again 
but i don t know why you should behorrified seeing that we are entre quatre yeux here and not on one ofyour pious example platforms 
you know you ve been in a far hotter shopthan monte carlo see me pot that red 
ah rouge perd barcelona towit 
if you remember you were staying at the cuatro naciones and atnights you used to cross the rhambla and  mr 
onslow how did you know all this  do you remember objecting to take a sheaf of obvious spurious notes and there was a row and somebody whipped out a knife and somebody elsefloored the knife-man with a chair  yes no  after which you very sensibly bolted 
well i had only just that momentcome in but i saw you were a fellow-islander and that s why i handledthe chair 
you don t remember me and i didn t know your name but irecognized you the moment your wife introduced us because i never forgeta face  you re mistaken 
i never was in such a place in my life sir 
think ofthe position i occupy 
why the thing s absurd  now my good sir why waste lies 
i m not going to show you up 
nofear 
why should i 
it would probably ruin you and i should standself-convicted of being in the lowest and most desperate gambling hellin europe without being made a sixpence richer by the transaction 
onlyyou didn t know me and you thought i didn t know you and i thought itwould be handier if we were open about one another s little ways at oncebefore we went any further 
who knows but what we might be partners insome profitable business together onslow put his cue down and facedhis host with hands deep in his trousers pockets 
 it s worth thinkingabout he observed 
mr theodore shelf stood before the fireplace and drew a handkerchiefacross his forehead with trembling fingers 
 what business do you referto he asked at length 
 none whatever 
i m not a business man 
i make discoveries and don t knowhow to use them 
you are a business man and may be able to see where themoney profit comes in 
if you can why then we ll share the plunder 
ifyou can t we re neither of us worse off than before  but this is vague 
what sort of discoveries 
have you found a mine  no sir in the present instance a channel  a channel i don t understand you  a deep-water channel leading in to a certain coast where everybody elsesupposes there is nothing but shallow water 
the government charts putdown the place as partly unsurveyed but all impossible for navigation 
the upgrowth of coral they say is turning part of the sea into dryland 
in a large measure this is true but at one point which i havediscovered a river comes down from the interior and the scour of thisriver has cut a deep narrow channel out through the reefs to the deep seawater beyond  well shelf broke in i see no value in that  wait a minute 
in confidence i ll tell you it is on the west coast offlorida on the mexican gulf coast 
the interior of southern floridais called the everglades 
it s partly lake partly swamp built up ofmangroves saw-grass cypress trees and water tenanted by snakes alligators wild beasts and a few seminole indians 
only one expeditionof whites has been across it or rather only one expedition known tohistory 
but i ve been there right into the heart of the everglades infact i ve just come from there and i netted out of the trip  how asked shelf eagerly 
 never mind exactly how 
that s partly another man s business 
shall wesay the other man gave me a commission there and i carried it out andgot duly paid 
anyway that s sufficient explanation 
but now about thischannel i ve found 
if one gives it to the chart people they ll simplysay thank you and publish your name in one number of an officialmagazine which nobody reads 
i don t long for fame of that kind 
i ve thesordid taste to much prefer gold  i think i understand you said shelf 
 give me a minute to think itout  a week if you like said the other and picking up his cue againreturned to the billiard-table 
the balls clicked lazily and the rosewood clock marked off the secondswith firmness and precision 
shelf lay back in his chair his finger-tipstogether beneath the square chin his eyes watching the shadows whichthe lamps cast on the frescoed ceiling 
he looked entirely placid 
noone would have guessed the simmer of thoughts which were poppling andbubbling in his brain 
a stream of projects came before him flashed intodetail and were dismissed as impracticable 
it was the great trait ofthis man s genius that he could think with the speed of a hurricane andclear his head of an unprofitable idea a moment after it was born 
twenty schemes occurred to him all to be dismissed and then came thetwenty-first and that stayed 
he ran a mental finger through all itsleading details he conned over a thousand minuti 
it was the thing tosuit his purpose 
a bare minute had passed but he needed no more time for hisdeliberations 
the scheme seemed perfect to him without flaw withoutchance of improvement 
the hugeness of it thrilled him like a draught ofspirit 
he was betrayed away from his unctuous calm his hands dropped onto the arms of the chair 
with a heavy start he clambered to his feet strode forward and seizedonslow by the arm 
 if your channel and everglades will answer a purposei want there s half a million of english sovereigns to be made out ofit onslow turned and faced him with a long thin-drawn whistle 
 
phew  hush 
there s somebody coming 
but it s to be had if you re not afraidof a little risk  i fear nothing on this earth said onslow when it s to my interestnot to fear 
moreover though i m not a saint my standard of moralityis probably a shade higher than yours 
i don t mind doing some sorts ofdirty things but there are shades in dirtiness and at some tints i drawthe line 
it s dangerous to er have the tips of these cues glued on sobadly 
they fly off and hit people the billiard-room door had opened and amy rivers had come in withfairfax at her heels 
hence onslow s digression 
the matter had not beenput in so many words but he felt sure that the commission of a greatrobbery had been proposed to him and he had more than half a mind todrive his knuckles into theodore shelf s lying hypocritical face on thespot 
chapter iii 
the requirements of mrs 
shelf 
mr theodore shelf wanted to drag onslow off there and then to his ownbusiness-room on the first floor to discuss further this great projectwhich he had in his head but onslow thought fit to remain where he was 
mr 
shelf nodded significantly towards the new-comers as much as to hintthat a third person with them would be distinctly an inconvenient third 
onslow turned to them cue in hand and proposed a game of snooker 
 that s precisely what we came up for said amy rivers promptly 
 hamilton get out the balls 
mr onslow will you put the billiard-ballsaway so that they don t get mixed they played and talked merrily 
their conversation turned on the wretchedshow at the recent academy which they agreed was a disgrace to acivilized country and onslow made himself interesting over the art ofpainting in paris mural facial and on canvas 
when he chose he could bevery interesting this man london had nicknamed the great traveler and he generally chose not being ill-natured 
mr theodore shelf left the billiard-room with a feeling beneath hiswaistcoat much akin to sea-sickness 
first of all that plain-spokenpatrick onslow had not over politely hinted that he was a cantinghypocrite and had showed cause for arriving at the conclusion 
this wastrue but that didn t make it any the more digestive 
and secondly hehimself in a moment of excitement had let drop to this same perniciousonslow who after all was a comparative stranger a proposal to make thesum of at one coup 
true he had not mentioned the means but onslow had at once concluded it was to be gained by robbery and he theodore shelf had not denied the impeachment 
consequently mr 
shelf went direct to his own room locked the door andfortified his nerves with a liberal allowance of brandy 
then he muncheda coffee-bean in deference to the blue ribbon on his coat-lapel replacedthe cognac bottle in the inner drawer of his safe and sat down to think 
if only he understood onslow and better still knew whether he mighttrust him there was a fortune to be had 
yes a fortune 
and it waswanted badly 
the great firm of marmaduke rivers and shelf which calleditself agents to the oceanic steam transport co but which really ranthe line of steamers which traded under that flag might look prosperousto the outer eye and might still rear its head haughtily amongst thefirst shipping firms of london port 
but the man who bragged aloud thathe owned it all from offices to engine-oil knew otherwise 
he hadmortgages out in every direction mortgages so cunningly hidden thatonly he himself was aware of their vast total 
he knew that the firm wasrotten lock stock and barrel 
he knew that through any one of twentychannels a breakup might come any day and following on the heels ofthat a smash which would be none the pleasanter because from its sizeand devastating effects it would live down into history 
he theodore shelf would assuredly not be in england to face it 
sincehis commercial barometer had reached stormy and still showed signs ofsteady descent he had been transmitting carefully modulated doles tocertain south american banks and had even gone so far as to purchase under a nom d escroc a picturesquely situated estan ia on the upperwaters of the rio paraguay 
there in case the tempest of bankruptcy broke the extradition treatieswould cease from troubling and the weary swindler would be at well-fedrest 
but mr theodore shelf had no lust for this tropical retirement 
heliked the powers of his present pinnacle in the city 
and that howl ofexecration from every class of society which would make up his p an ofdefeat was an opera that he very naturally shrank from sitting through 
as he thought of these things he hugged closer to him the wire-hairedfox-terrier which sat upon his lap 
 george old friend said mr 
shelf if things do go wrong i believeyou are the only thing living in england which won t turn against me george slid out a red tongue and licked the angle of mr shelf s squarechin 
then he retired within himself again and looked sulky 
the doorhad opened and mrs 
shelf stood on the mat 
there was a profound mutualdislike between george and mrs theodore shelf 
 you alone theodore 
i thought mr onslow was here 
however so much thebetter 
i have wanted to speak with you all the morning 
do turn thatnasty dog away george was not evicted and mr 
shelf inquired curtly what his wife waspleased to want 
she seldom invaded this business-room of his and when she did it was for a purpose which he was beginning to abhor 
shecame to the point at once by handing him a letter which was mostly incopperplate 
he read it through with brief sour comment 
 h m 
bank 
your private account overdrawn 
that s the third time thisyear laura 
warning seems to be no use 
you are determined to know whatruin tastes like  ruin pshaw 
you don t put me off with that silly tale 
to begin with i don t believe it for an instant and even if it were true i d ratherbe ruined than retrench 
you and i can afford to be candid betweenourselves theodore 
you know perfectly well that we have gained ourposition in society purely and solely by purchase  to my cost i do know it 
but having paid your entrance fee at leasteight times over i think you might be content with an ordinarysubscription 
the ball last night for instance  was necessary 
and i couldn t afford to do the thing otherwise thangorgeously  gorgeously 
do you think i m a cr sus laura to pay for gearing oneroom with red roses and another room with pink and another room withmarshal niels for fools to flit in during one short night 
this morning spaper informs me that those flowers came by special express from nice and cost five hundred pounds  and yet you twit me with extravagance 
all the papers have got in thatparagraph as i took care they should and everybody will read it 
yetthe flowers only cost a paltry three hundred pounds so that in credit iam two hundred to the good because i have clearly given the ball ofthe season 
theodore you are short-sighted you are a fool to your ownprofit 
by myself i shall make you a baronet this year and if you hadonly worked in your own interests half as hard as i have done you couldhave entered the house of lords  titles said shelf grimly for people of our stamp are only givenfor direct cash outlay in almshouses or picture galleries or politicalclubs 
before they are bestowed a crown censor satisfies himself thatone s financial position is broad and absolutely sound 
there are reasonsconnected with those matters which block you further and further frombeing milady every day mrs 
shelf shrugged her shoulders in utter unbelief 
 your preachingtendencies cover you like a second skin theodore 
it seems as if younever drop the conventicle and the pleasure of pointing a moral at one 
believe me is isn t a paying speculation this cant of yours 
at themost they would only give you a trumpery knighthood for it 
but go yourown way and i ll go mine 
you shall be made in spite of yourself mrs 
shelf noticed that at this point her husband s eyes were beginningto glow with dull fury 
she objected to scenes and dropping thesubject reverted once more to her present needs 
 however let us stop this wrangle and come to business 
i wish you tosee to that impertinent circular from the bank 
i have several checksout and unpresented i am absolutely compelled to draw others to-day for trifles which will add up to about a thousand 
you will kindly seethat they are honored 
it is all your own fault this trumpery worryabout nothing 
you should not try and screw me down to such a niggardlyallowance shelf stood up and the dog on his lap leaped hurriedly to the groundgrowling 
 woman he said passionately you won t believe me but ifyou will go on in this mad extravagance you will soon learn for yourselfthat i am not lying perhaps very soon 
perhaps to-morrow 
when a shamefulbankruptcy does come then you can play your hand as you please 
i shallnot be here to hinder you any longer 
where shall i go how i shalllead my new life who will be my partner are matters which you will beallowed no finger in 
so long as things last here i shall observe allthe conventionalities and if you appreciate those you will find itwise to reconsider your present ways 
i tell you candidly that if thefirm does go down not only england but half the world will ring withits transactions 
marmaduke rivers and shelf he went on with scowlingfury were honest prosperous tradesmen once before their ways werefouled to find money for your cursed ambition there was a new look on theodore shelf s clean-shaven face which hiswife had never seen before and an evil glint in the eyes which scaredher 
irresolutely she moved towards the door and put her fingers uponthe handle 
then she drew herself up and stared him up and down with alook of forced contempt 
 you will be good enough she said coldly toattend to the business which brought me here 
i am going now to draw thechecks i spoke about shelf looked at her very curiously 
 go he said and do as you please 
you are a determined woman and because i am determined myself i admireyour strength of will but for all that i think i shall murder you beforei leave england mrs 
shelf laughed derisively but with pale lips and then she openedthe door 
 what fine heroics she said 
 but thanks for seeing after my balance 
imust have that money she passed through the door closing it gently behind her and shelfreturned to his armchair 
 george he said as the fox-terrier stood up against his knee ifthat woman were only struck dead to-day there are two thousand familiesin england who would rejoice madly if they only knew one-tenth part ofwhat i know 
poor beggars they have trusted me to the hilt and shemakes me behave to them like a fiend 
d you know my small animal i wishvery much just now an earthquake or a revolution or something like thatwould occur to shuffle matters up 
then if i got killed i should bespared a great deal of worry and if i didn t why i ve got large hands and i believe could grab enough in the general scramble to suit evenher 
as it is however with neither earthquake nor revolution probable i m a desperate man ready to take any desperate chance of commercialsalvation 
eh well he concluded as he reached for a paper-block andrested it on george s back worrying myself about the matter won timprove it 
the only thing is to try and keep things running in theirpresent groove he broke off and scribbled a biblical text 
 other menwould have been suspected long before this 
but my reputation has savedme he smiled to himself softly 
 what a thing it is to be known as athoroughly good man he broke off at this point and applied himself with gusto to writing hissermon for the ensuing sunday 
chapter iv 
business at a ball 
when people are engaged they usually contrive to meet with frequency and so amy rivers showed no very great surprise at seeing fairfax againlater in the evening 
she only said why i didn t know you knew thelatchfords to which hamilton fairfax replied that he did not know them but had met another man at the club who was coming to the party and thatthe other man had brought him 
 an extra male never matters at a big dance said fairfax 
 besides hewent on i wanted particularly to see you this evening 
since we partedlast i ve heard of an estate for sale in kent which i fancy would justsuit us 
the present holder wants money and therefore it s going cheap but there s another fellow after it and i ve only got the refusal tillto-morrow morning 
so you see i want your views on the subject at once  very well said miss rivers you shall tell me about it in say three dances from now 
there are no programs here to-night but i havepromised the next two waltzes and the square and don t particularlywant to cut them 
in the mean time i wish you would go and talk to mrs 
shelf 
she said when we were driving here that she wanted to speak toyou 
i don t know about what but she ll tell you that herself  right said fairfax 
 ta-ta for the present and he went through therooms till he saw the blaze of diamonds and rubies which decked thehandsome person of mrs theodore shelf 
mrs 
shelf had as usual a concourse of men round her 
she was a womanwho deliberately cultivated the art of fascination because it wasessential to her ambition and men are always willing to be dazzled andfascinated 
they were laughing when fairfax came up 
she saw him from thecorner of her eyes but for the moment took no notice of him 
she leanedforward and delivered another sentence to the men before her throughthe top feathers of her fan which sent through them another thrill ofmerriment and then shut the fan with a click and turned to fairfax 
the other men went away still laughing which was quite typical of mrs shelf s powers 
she always concluded her audiences dramatically 
noactress on the stage had more knowledge of how to bring about an artistic curtain she watched them go with a smile of mild triumph but when she turned tofairfax this had flitted away 
there was distinct annoyance on her face 
 why don t you know these people here she asked 
 well i suppose i may say that technically i do know lady latchford now 
the chap who brought me introduced me to her 
but of course she ll haveforgotten me by this time  then why didn t you stop and talk to her amuse her or better still be impertinent to her 
you ought to have known the latchfords before 
indeed i thought you did but to slip in like that without a noise wasworse than a mistake it was a crime 
don t you know that the latchfordsare useful 
really hamilton you make me angry 
you never make theslightest effort to get on and know people who will be useful to you and all that fairfax felt half amused half annoyed 
he shrugged his shoulders 
 i don t know what amy will do with you when she marries mrs 
shelfwent on 
 you ve no dash about you no smartness 
if you are left toyourself you may make money but you will never make a name  i m not a man said fairfax with a half-angry laugh who would everwalk about in spurs and blow a trumpet  no replied mrs 
shelf you would if you had your own way work tenhours a day in the city and then come home and sleep 
once a month youwould give a dinner party to city friends and talk shop the entireevening 
in the end you would die and have written on your gravestone  this was a dull honest man who made a million of money and noenemies now i said mrs 
shelf should feel lonely beyond belief ifi didn t know that there were people who hated and feared me 
it givesone the sense of power and that means confidence and a woman withconfidence gets on 
it is only your harmless fool who is popular allround and a person whom everybody in their innermost hearts despise whatever they may say of him aloud 
you must shake this mood off hamilton 
begin now 
go up to the latchford woman and be impertinentto her 
say the floor s so bad you can t dance on it or the supper spoisoned you or that there s a woman here who picks pockets 
put itnicely you know and make it cut and then she ll ask you to her nextfunction because she ll think you too dangerous to make an enemy of  i don t feel equal to the job said fairfax 
 it would probably end inmy being kicked there and then out of doors if i attempted such a thing  nonsense said mrs 
shelf 
 polite impertinence is the best possible cachet nowadays 
and you must cut out some style for yourself 
go andbegin now she dismissed him with a tap of her fan and beckoned another man up 
fairfax went off willingly enough but he did not go and impress himselfupon his hostess s memory by the crude process of baiting her 
instead he hung about the rooms and idled away his time till amy rivers was readyfor him and then slipping her arm through his led her to a niche on asecluded staircase 
 now she said tell me all about this place in kent he told her soberly and quietly all the details and waxed dry overleases and repairs of outbuildings 
 it sounds lovely she said when he had finished but you don t seemvery enthusiastic over it yourself  that s not my way dear 
mrs 
shelf has been telling me what a very dullyoung man i am and suggested that i should commence improving matters bygoing up and insulting my hostess 
i m afraid i haven t done it 
to beginwith i couldn t and to go on with she d squash me out of existencewith a look if i made the attempt 
you see amy i know my limitations i m a tolerably heavy person with limited powers of speech and asubdued sense of humor  you might be brighter that s a fact miss rivers admitted candidly 
 if you are tired of me dear miss rivers craned her neck down the line of the banisters to make surethat no one was looking and then drew fairfax to her and gave him akiss 
 don t be a great goose she said 
 only don t think that i am going toagree with you in everything 
that would be far too dull and copy-booky 
and don t think i imagine you perfect 
i should hate you most cordiallyif you were  what are my faults  do you think i could tell you the whole list in a single evening 
no sir 
some day when i am more than usually annoyed with you i will beginearly and read out a chapter of them 
till then i ll bear with the lot 
tell me some more about this place in kent  i have told you all i know 
if you like the idea we might run downto-morrow and see it ourselves before we finally decide on the purchase 
the only thing is about the price 
you know i m a tolerably well-off man dear but there are limits to my capital and most of it is well lockedup 
of course this place has to be paid for in cash which is the reasonfor its going so cheap  well  well i am afraid that alone it would not be wise for me to purchase it 
but then one cannot get over the fact that you are an heiress excuse mybeing unromantic and practical and we are presumably not going to live onmy income only 
and so if the house and its grounds should suit us iwas wondering whether you would feel disposed  oh my dear child how you do beat about the bush 
of course i ll helpbuy the place if we like it 
why shouldn t i 
there s heaps of money andthere s no earthly reason why we shouldn t use it  but will the trustees let you have it  i m not of age for another year but the trustees have discretionarypower 
at least mr 
shelf has and he never thwarts me in anything 
i believe he d do anything for me 
he is really the kindest man 
ifyou like hamilton i ll see him about it before he goes out to-morrowmorning  i think that will be best dear 
you see in the present state of theoffer one has to rush things  how much am i to ask him for  fifteen thousand pounds would do 
i can manage the rest  oh he ll let me have that without any trouble at all 
i m sure of it 
and if the other trustee was awkward he d advance it to me for the yearout of his own pocket 
listen there s the music going again 
aren t yougoing to dance with me to-night hamilton  ye-es a waltz or anything like that 
but they re playing thatabominable barn-dance 
i think it s idiotic 
makes such a show of one sself 
let s sit it out here  not i i love the barn-dance 
i do it well and i dress for it 
consequently my dear boy i m not going to miss it 
you needn t kick up your heels unless you like but i warn you i m going to disport myself 
come along and take me down-stairs 
there now 
you ve ruffled my hairagain  come along then said fairfax 
 you can knock over my worstprejudices 
i ll dance two barn-dances with you if i get theopportunity chapter v bimetallism 
it was late in the evening when patrick onslow again found himself ent te- -t te with his host 
there had been people in to dinner at thehouse in park lane but these had gone and mrs 
shelf and amy riversfollowed them to lady latchford s dance 
mrs 
shelf had wished to carryonslow also in her train but that person stayed behind by a requestwhich he could not very well refuse 
 you will favor me very much byremaining here for the rest of the evening mr onslow shelf had saidin his pompous way 
 i have matters of the greatest moment which i wishto discuss with you  i hardly know how to begin shelf confessed uneasily when they werealone 
 then let me make a suggestion said onslow with a laugh 
 come to thepoint at once 
let s have the plot without any introductory chapters 
you ve told me you ve got a scheme on hand for turning my discovery intocurrency and you ve rather hinted that it s a dirty scheme 
the onlyquestion is how dirty 
thanks to pressure of circumstances i m not anover-particular person but on points i m very squeamish or in otherwords i draw the line somewhere 
unless i m very vastly mistaken yourplan will involve one in downright knavery which is a thing all sensiblemen avoid if possible 
now in my ignorance i fancied the find might beturned to account without climbing down to that  oh said shelf eagerly then you had a scheme in your head before youcame to me the other shrugged his shoulders and lit a cigar 
 just a dim outline nothing more 
you see the interior of the everglades is absolutelyuntouched by the white man s weapons 
it was vaguely supposed to be onevast lake with oases of slime and mangroves 
the lake was reported astoo shallow for boats and abounding with fevers agues and mosquitoes 
consequently it remained unexplored and on the end of the floridapeninsula to-day no white man barring myself and one or two others hasever got further than five or eight miles in from the coast 
now asi ve told you i was lucky enough to hit upon a fine deep ship-channelgoing in as far as the center line and i don t know how far beyondinside 
there is good fertile country a healthy climate and the bestgame-preserve on this earth 
for the first comers that interior willbe just a sportsman s paradise 
my idea is two-wise 
first sell thecream off the sport 
some men will give anything for shooting and inthis case there will also be the glamour of being pioneers 
each onewill start determined to write a book of his opinions and doings when hegets back 
by chartering a steamer and treating them well on board theywould have sporting de luxe and one ought to get quite five-and-twentychaps at five hundred guineas apiece 
that gives the first crop 
for thesecond buy up an enormous tract of the land which can be got for halfnothing say ten or fifteen cents an acre boom it and resell it in lotsto jugginses 
they ll fancy they ll grow oranges as all englishmen dowho try florida 
perhaps they may grow them who knows if they keep offwhisky and put in work 
but that won t be the promoters concern 
theydon t advertise that the land will produce oranges they only guaranteethat it would if it was given a chance and that s all correct 
perhapsthis is rough on the jugginses but as they crowd these british islandsin droves and are always on the look-out for some one to shear them i don t see why an everglades company shouldn t have their fleeces aswell as anybody else 
they re mostly wasters and wouldn t do any mortalgood anywhere and it s a patriotic deed to cart them over our boundaryditch away from local mischief 
besides even if the worst comes to theworst and the orange industry of florida still refuses to make headway the would-be growers needn t starve nor need they even do what they llprobably hate more and that s work 
there s always sweet potatoes andmullet and tobacco to be got and if that diet doesn t cloy a man canhave it there for mighty little exertion 
come now 
that s the pemmicanof the plan 
what do you think of it  much capital would be needed onslow shrugged his shoulders 
 some naturally or i shouldn t have cometo you 
if i d seen any way to pouching all the plunder single-handed youmay bet your life mr theodore shelf i shouldn t have invited you intopartnership  returns too would be very slow  not necessarily 
float the company and then turn it over to anothercompany for cash down  moreover when the er the young men you spoke about found that theorange-groves did not produce at once in paying quantities they wouldwrite home and their parents would denounce me as a swindler in thenewspapers  no not you the other company the one you sold it to 
but thenapologists would arise to show that the jugginses don t shy at the word sir were lazy and ignorant and also that they absorbed the corn whiskyof the country in excessive quantities 
and then that company could grinsmugly and pose as a misunderstood benefactor 
so its profits wouldn tbe smirched in the least 
grasp that  yes yes i dare say you have worked it all out to yourself and thoughtover the details so many times that the whole scheme seems entirelyplausible 
but looking at it from the view of a business man i cannotsay that it appears to be an enterprise i should care to embark in 
yousee it is so very much beyond the scope of my general operations thati er hesitate er you understand i hesitate  yes said patrick onslow quietly you hesitate because you ve gotsomething ten times more profitable up your sleeve shelf started and shivered slightly 
 you may as well be candid and open with me onslow continued andtell me what you are driving at 
if it suits me i ll say so and if itdoesn t i ll let you know with surprising promptness 
and again if wedon t trade you may rely on me not to gossip about your suggestion 
i mnot the stone-throwing variety of animal 
you see i live in a sort ofsemi-greenhouse myself there was a minute s pause during which theodore shelf shifted about asthough his chair was uneven rock beneath him 
then he jerked out histale sentence by sentence squinting sideways at his companion betweeneach period 
 you know i m a shipowner in a large way of business onslow nodded 
 ships are occasionally lost at sea steamers even new steamers straightout of a builder s yard and well found in every particular  so i ve read in the newspaper  and every shipowner insures his vessels to the full of their value  except when he has a foreboding that they will come to grief ona voyage 
then so rumor says he usually has the forethought toover-insure mr theodore shelf passed a handkerchief over his forehead and startedwhat was apparently a new topic 
 there is a silver crisis on just now in the united states and by thismorning s paper the dollar is down at sixty cents 
american gold is notto be had 
english gold is always worth its face value 
what more naturalfinancial operation could there be than to ship out sovereigns andprofit by the discrepancy  ah said onslow so the new and valuable steamer which thoughover-insured is likely to be reported lost is evidently to have aconsignment of specie on board 
 i fancy you mentioned asthe figure in the billiard-room this morning 
well if one is goingin for robbery or piracy i suppose it would turn out to be in thisinstance there s nothing like a large coup 
it s your niggler whousually fails and gets laid by the heels 
drive on and be a little moreexplicit  couldn t the steamer be lost somehow in the gulf of mexico and a boatcontaining the boxes of specie find its way through this channel of yoursinto the interior of florida  how lost mr 
shelf mopped his forehead again 
 don t steamers he asked don tthey sometimes have sad accidents which which cause them to blow up  such things have been known 
but it s rather rough on the crew don tyou think  oh poor fellows yes 
but a sailor s life is always hazardous 
indeed what can he expect with wages at their present ruinous rate 
shipownersmust live  oh you beauty said patrick onslow 
 i must ask you cried shelf with a sudden burst of sourness torefrain from these comments sir 
but tell me before i go any further inthis confidence am i to count upon your assistance  that depends upon many things 
to begin with there ll have to bemodifications before i dabble 
i m not obtrusively squeamish about humanlife my own or other people s 
on occasion i bagged my man because hehad twice shot at me 
still piracy complicated with what practicallyamounts to murder is an art which i haven t trafficked in as yet and curious to relate i don t intend to begin 
your scheme is delicious inits cold-bloodedness but it would look better if it were toned down atrifle 
by the way better help yourself to a drink 
your nerves are insuch a joggle that i fancy you ll faint if you don t 
i notice there sno blue ribbon on your evening dress 
humph 
that s a second mate snip four fingers if it s a drop apparently you are used to this 
tellme now what honorarium do you propose i should take for engineering thispiece of rascality in your favor  i will give you five hundred pounds  now would you really 
not even guineas  mr 
onslow i ll make it a thousand 
there  mr 
theodore shelf when a monkey wants a cat to pull chestnuts for himout of the fire he first has to be stronger than the cat 
you don toccupy that enviable position 
in fact i have the whip-hand of you inevery way 
we need not particularize but you can sum the items foryourself 
now i ll make you an offer 
half of all the plunder and entirecontrol of everything  great heavens 
do you want to ruin me  i don t care in the least if i do 
your welfare doesn t interest me 
butmy services are on the market with a prix fix and you can take em orleave em 
that s final shelf burst into a torrent of expostulations exciting himself more andmore as he went on till at last he stood before the other with grippedfists and the veins ridged out down his neck inarticulate with fury 
onslow heard him out with a contemptuous smile but when the man hadstormed himself into silence then he spoke coolly and coldly  when one trades in life and death the brokerage is heavy 
you haveheard my offer 
if you don t like it say so without further palaver and i ll leave you now with your conscience if you have a rag of such acommodity left  you may sit where you are replied shelf sullenly 
 well and good 
that means to say my terms are accepted 
i ll pin you tothem later 
but for the present let me observe to you something else so that there may be no misunderstanding between us 
i ve been ramblingup and down the world half my life and i ve met blackguards of mostdescriptions in every iniquitous place from callao to port sa d forgers thieves murderers of nearly every grade of proficiency 
but they saythat the prime of everything gets to london and i verily believe nowthat it does for by jove you are the most pernicious scoundrel of allthe collection  sir thundered shelf am i to listen to these foul insults in my ownhouse  oh i quite understand the obligations of bread and salt but you arebeyond the pale of that 
you are a noxious beast who ought to be stampedout 
still you can be useful to me so i shall hire myself out to beuseful to you 
but i have brought these unpleasant facts under yournotice to let you thoroughly understand that i have summed you up fromhorns to hoofs and to point out to you that i wouldn t give a piastrefor your most sacred word of honor 
we shall be bound to one another inthis precious scheme by community of interests alone and if you canswindle me you may 
only look out for the consequences if you do try iton 
i never yet left a score unpaid 
we re arcades ambo rascals both only we re different varieties of rascal 
i know you pretty thoroughly and if you don t know me as well possibly you will before we ve donewith one another 
and now if it please you we ll go into the minuterdetails of this piece of villainy and sketch out definitely how weare to steal this half a million in specie and this valuable steamer without committing more murder than is absolutely essential to success chapter vi 
the tempting of captain owen kettle 
 if one might judge from the lacquered majesty of your officeappointments said patrick onslow taking one of the big chairs inshelf s inner sanctum your firm is doing a roaring fine business mr theodore shelf seated himself before his desk and began sortingout some papers 
 the turnover he said evasively is enormous 
ouroperations are most extensive  extensive and peculiar commented onslow 
 but i regret to say that during the last eighteen months the firm sprofits have seriously decreased and the scope of its operations beenmuch hampered 
i take credit to myself that this diminution could havebeen prevented by no action on my part 
it is entirely the outcome ofthe times and the lazy greed of the working classes fomented by thefrothings of paid agitators 
the series of strikes which we have had tocontend against is unprecedented  is it 
well i don t know 
there have been labor bothers all downthrough history and i fancy they ll continue to the end of time 
ifyou ll recollect there was a certain egyptian king who once had troubleswith his bricklayers and i fancy there have been similar difficultiestrotting through the centuries in pretty quick succession ever since 
of course each man thinks his own employ s the most unreasonable andgrasping that have ever uttered opinion since the record began that sonly natural 
but i might point out to you that in definite results youaren t in the worst box yet 
your chariot hasn t been upset in the redsea so far and it may be that a certain operation in the mexican gulfwill grease up the wheels and set it running on triumphantly 
grumble ifyou like mr 
shelf but don t make yourself out to be the worst-used manin history 
pharaoh hadn t half your opportunities  yes yes said shelf who didn t relish this kind of conversation butwe will come to business if you please  right you are 
let s finish floating the swindle  mr 
onslow exclaimed the other passionately will you never learnto moderate your language 
there are a hundred clerks within a hundredfeet of you through that door and sometimes even walls can listen andrepeat 
besides i object altogether to your phraseology 
we engage in nosuch things as swindles in the city 
our operations are all commercialenterprises  very well said onslow shrugging his shoulders don t let s squabbleover it 
you call your spade what you like only i reserve a right toclap on a plainer brand 
we re built differently mr 
shelf 
i preferto be honest in my dishonesty 
and now as i ve said let s get tobusiness 
you say the charter of this steamer of yours the port edes has expired and she is back on your hands 
she s tons built underlloyds survey and classed a 
she s well engined and has justbeen dry-docked 
she ll insure for every sixpence of her value withoutcomment and there s nothing more natural than to send out your specie insuch a sound bottom 
remains to pick a suitable complement  i ve got a master waiting here now by appointment 
his name is kettle 
ihave him to a certain extent under my thumb and i fancy he will prove areliable man 
he was once in our firm s employment  owen kettle by any chance mr theodore shelf referred to a paper on his writing-table 
 captainowen kettle yes 
he was the man who lost the doge of venice and sincethen he s never had another ship  poor devil 
yes i know 
that doge of venice case was an awfulscandal 
owners filled up the board of trade surveyor to the teeth withchampagne or she d never have been passed to sea 
as it was she dsuch an unholy reputation that two crews ran from her before they couldget her manned 
she was as rotten as rust and tumbled rivets could makeher and she was sent to sea as a coffin ship to earn her dividendsout of lloyds 
kettle had been out of a job for some time 
he was adesperate man with a family depending on him and he went as skipper fully conscious of what was expected of him 
he did it like a man 
he letthe doge of venice founder in a north sea gale and by a marvelouschance managed to save his ship s company 
at the inquiry of course he was made scapegoat and he didn t contrive to save his ticket 
theysuspended his master s certificate for a year 
on the strength of thathe applied to owners for maintenance putting it on the reasonable claimof services rendered 
owners being upright merchants and sensiblemen naturally repudiated all knowledge or liability said he was ablackmailing scoundrel as well as an unskilful seaman and threatened himwith an action for libel 
kettle not having a solitary proof to show did the only thing left for him to do and that was eat dirt or subside 
but the incident and the subsequent starvation haven t tended to sweetenhis temper 
latterly he s been serving as mate on a pacific ship and hewas just a terror with his men 
he simply kept alive by carrying his fiston a revolver-butt 
there isn t a man who s served with red kettle threeweeks that wouldn t have cheerfully swung for the enjoyment of murderinghim  you appear to know a good deal about this man  when it suits my purpose returned onslow drily i mostly contrive toknow something about anybody 
however it s no use discussing the poorbeggar any longer 
what s amiss with having him in now shelf touched one of the electric buttons which studded the edge of histable and a clerk appeared who went away again and shortly returned 
with him was a dried-up little man of about forty with a red head and apeaked red beard who made a stiff nervous salaam to mr theodore shelf and then turned to stare at onslow with puckered amazement 
onslow nodded and laughed 
 been carrying any more pilgrims from portsa d to the morocco coast on iron decks he asked 
 i never did that snapped captain kettle 
 ah one s memory fails at times 
i dare say also you forget a waterfamine when the condenser broke down and a trifling affray withknuckledusters and other toys and a dash of cholera and nine deadbodies of hadjis which went overboard 
perhaps too you don t rememberfudging a clean bill of health and baksheeshing certain officials of hisshereefian majesty  no said captain kettle sourly i don t remember  i m going to forget it also if you ll prove yourself a sensible man and deal amicably with mr 
shelf and myself 
i m also going to forgetthat when you were shipping rice for calcutta in you rented mats youcalled your own to the consignor and made a tidy penny out of that andi shall similarly let slip from my memory a trifling squeeze of eighthundred dollars which you made out of a stevedore in new orleans beforeyou let him touch your ship in the fall of  you can t make anything out of those said kettle 
 they re theordinary customs of the trade  shipmasters perquisites for which owners pay 
exactly 
i know someskippers consider these trifles to be their lawful right 
but a court oflaw might be ignorant enough to set them down as robbery  i should like to know where you ve got all these things from captainkettle demanded facing onslow with his lean scraggy neck thrust forthnearly a foot from its stepping 
 i should like to know too how you rehere 
i d a fancy you were dead  other people have labored under that impression 
but i ve an awkwardknack of keeping alive 
you ve the same 
the faculty may prove usefulto us both in the course of the next month if you re not ass enough torefuse  ho 
that s the game we ve got bent is it 
what old wind-jammer do youwant me to lose now  sir thundered shelf lifting his voice for the first time 
 this ispretty language 
i would have you remember that but a short time ago youwere in my employ  and a fat lot of good it did me retorted the sailor 
 but he added with the sudden recollection that it is never wise of a master mariner toirritate any shipowner but sir i wasn t talking to you 
i fancied itwas mr onslow here who was wanting to deal with me  then your fancy carried you astray captain said shelf 
 come come don t let s get angry with one another 
as i repeatedly impress on allwho come in contact with me there is never any good born out of wordsvoiced in anger 
mr onslow has seen fit to mention a few of your shall isay eccentricities just to show er that we understand one another  to show he s got his knife in me mr 
shelf and can wraggle it if hechooses  what a fractious pepper-box it is said onslow with a laugh 
 man dear if i ve got to be shipmate with you for a solid month d ye thinki d put your back up more than s necessary 
if you remember me at all you must know i m the deuce of a stickler for my own personal comfort andconvenience 
you can bet i haven t been talking at you through gratuitouscruelty 
but mr 
shelf and i have got a yarn to bring out directly whichis a bit of a coarse tough-fibered yarn and we didn t want you to giveit a top-dressing of varnish 
so by way of safeguard i pointed out toyou that if we show ourselves to be sinners you needn t sing out thatyou find yourself in evil company for the first time mr theodore shelf had been shuffling his feet uneasily for some time 
onslow s method of speech jarred him to the verge of profanity 
hisown saintliness was a garb which he never threw entirely away at anymoment 
his voice had always the oily drone of the conventicle 
his smughypocrisy was a perennial source of pride and comfort to him withoutwhich he would have felt very lonely and abandoned 
at this point he drew the conversation into his own hands 
it had beensaid of him that he always addressed the house of commons as though hewere addressing a congregation from the pulpit of his own tin tabernacle and he preached out his scheme of plunder violence and other moraluncleanness with similar fervent unction 
onslow was openly amused andonce broke out into a mocking laugh 
he was never at any pains to concealhis contempt for mr theodore shelf which was more honest than judiciouson his part 
kettle on the other hand wore the puckered face of a puzzled man 
thecombination of cant and criminality was not altogether new to him 
menof his profession are frequently apt to behave like fiends unbooted atsea and then grovel in clamorous piety amongst the pews of some obscuremeeting-house during all their stay ashore 
it is a peculiar trait but many a sea-scoundrel believes that he can lay up a stock of fireinsurance of this sort which will comfortably see him through futureefforts 
in kettle s mind however shipowners were a vastly differentclass of beings and so it never occurred to him that the same mightapply to them 
in this attitude captain kettle listened to the sermon which was reeledout to him and rather gathered that the project he was exhorted to takepart in was in some obscure manner a missionary enterprise promotedsolely in the honor and glory of mr theodore shelf s own particularnarrow little sect and had mr 
shelf made any appreciable pause betweenhis sonorous periods kettle would have felt it his respectful duty toslip in a humble amen but the dictator of the great shipping firm wastoo fearful of interruptions from his partner to give any opening for asyllable of comment 
but if captain owen kettle was unversed in the finer niceties of theart of hypocrisy he was a man of angular common-sense and by degreesit dawned upon him that mr shelf s project when removed of itstop-dressing of religion was in its naked self something very differentfrom what he had at first been drawn to believe 
as this idea grew upon him the devotional droop faded from the cornersof his lips and his mouth drew to a hard straight line scarcely to bedistinguished amongst the curving bristles of hair which surrounded it 
but he made no interruption and drank in every word till the speaker haddelivered the whole of his say 
then he uttered his decision 
 so gentlemen you are standing in as partners over this preciousbusiness 
and because you know me to be a poor broke man with a wifeand family you naturally think you can buy me to work for you off thestraight 
well perhaps that s possible but there are two ways of doingit and of the two i like mr onslow s best 
when a man s a blackguard it don t make him swallow any the sweeter for setting up to be a littletin saint 
and i don t mind who i say that to  my good man snarled shelf do you mean to threaten me  no i don t 
i just gave you my own opinion as from man to man just because i respect myself 
but i m not going round to your placeof worship to shout it out to them that sit under you 
they wouldn tbelieve me if i did 
not now at any rate 
besides it wouldn t do me anygood and i couldn t afford it 
i m a needy man mr 
shelf as you haveguessed and that s why i m going to accept your offer 
but don t let ushave any misunderstanding between ourselves as to what it foots up to 
what i m going to sign on for directly when you hand me the papers isa spell of piracy on the high seas neither more nor less 
and i m goingto have my money all paid down in advance before i ring an engine-bell onyour blasted tramp of a steamer 
i guess that s fair enough 
my family llwant something to go on with if i m caught because if one s found outat this game it s just a common ordinary hanging matter 
yes sir swingby the neck till i m dead as an ax and may heaven have mercy on your miserable tag of a soul 
that s what this tea-party means and for yourdirty you re buying a live human man chapter vii 
 in gold 
the little red-bearded man had gone slamming the door noisily behindhim 
shelf mopped his large white face with a scented pocket-handkerchief 
 do you think he said nervously do you think we may trust him  to begin with we ve got to now whether we like it or not 
he s nothingto gain by playing traitor  but would he betray us in case of success  perhaps said onslow he won t have the chance 
other hands on thatsteamer will have to share the secret in whole or in part 
perhaps theywon t all of them come through it alive 
if you remember that we areplotting deliberate piracy on the high seas you will recognize thatthere is precedent for a considerable percentage of casualties the city man shuddered 
through the double windows came the sullen roarof a london street and in imagination he seemed to distinguish the howlof the crowd joined in execration against him 
his eye fell upon a paper on the desk 
it was the formal notice from herbankers that his wife s account was heavily overdrawn 
he lifted thepaper and tore it with his teeth and then he smote the table with ashut fist so that geysers flew from the inkwells 
but his passion foundno outlet in words 
he spoke in his platform voice and said nothingabout the prime compelling force 
 we will not talk of these unpleasant details if you please mr onslow 
i my heart is weak i think and they turn me sick 
but at whatever cost we must go through with the affair 
it is necessary that i make a heavy coup within the next month or the consequences may be disastrous  marmaduke rivers and shelf will go down 
quite so 
i m also at theend of my cash balance so that money seems to be the impelling powerfor each of us 
but come now wake up sir and let s get on with thebusiness 
i m not so sweet on this city atmosphere of yours that i careto spend another morning down here if it can be avoided 
how are yougoing to raise the specie  i ll proceed about it at once said shelf pressing another of thebuttons on his desk 
 you may as well witness every step of the process in answer to the bell fairfax came into the room nodded rather stifflyto onslow and turned to shelf with an expectant yes sir in terse business-like phrase his principal touched upon the silvercrisis in america and the gold famine in the southern states 
then heexplained the external view of his projected enterprise 
 the port edes he said is in the herculaneum dock returned on ourhands to-day 
wire liverpool at once asking for freights to norfolkvirginia pensacola florida mobile alabama or new orleans at lowestrates 
new orleans is her final port and offer that at fifteen per cent 
less 
captain owen kettle will be in command and he sails in four daysfrom this 
when you have deputed your clerks to do this go yourself tothe bank and negotiate for half a million in gold to be delivered onboard the port edes in dock 
the insurance policy on the money will bedeposited with the bank to secure them in full for the loan itself andfor their other charges the credit of the house will easily suffice 
isthat clear  perfectly said fairfax but i should like to remind you of one thing wharf thefts at new orleans are notorious and you ll have to payheavily to insure against them  i know more heavily than for risks across the ocean and the run up theriver 
underwriters are justly nervous about those all-nation thieves 
but in this instance i propose to save myself that fee and insure in adifferent way 
mr onslow is going out on the port edes expressly asmy representative and i fancy that he and the captain together will becapable of seeing to safe delivery 
the ship s arrival will be reportedby telegraph from the pass at mississippi mouth and my new orleans agentcan calculate her appearance alongside the levee to a quarter of an hour 
he will meet her with vehicles and a strong escort of deputy-sheriffs asshe brings in to her berth and will take the specie-boxes off by thefirst gangway which is put ashore and carry them straight to a bank 
does this strike you as a sound course  yes said fairfax thoughtfully i see no undue risks 
by the way asthe port edes is merely a cargo tramp and doesn t hold a certificatefor passengers i m afraid the board of trade would not let mr onslowtravel by her simply as the firm s representative 
but that could beeasily overcome  oh said onslow i ll sign on articles in the usual way as one ofthe ship s company as fourth mate say or doctor with salary of oneshilling for the run 
 tisn t the first time that pleasing fiction hasbeen palmed upon a shipping-master 
it doesn t deceive any one you know because the rate of wages gives one away at the outset 
but the country spaternal mutton-headed shipping laws are obeyed and so everybody spleased fairfax laughed and went into the outer offices and patrick onslowturned to the shipowner with a couple of questions 
 to begin with he said why did you offer freights to norfolk andpensacola and mobile and those places 
if you call in there thenatural thing would be to get the specie ashore and express it byrailroad direct to new orleans 
if you miss that chance and startcarrying it round by sea the thing looks fishy at once 
now fishinessis an aspect which we can t afford in the very least degree 
the swindlewill call up enough sensation in its most honest and straightforwarddress  my dear mr onslow please give me credit for a little more finesse 
isee the objection to intermediate ports as much as you do but i merelymentioned them to fairfax as a blind 
to begin with it is a hundred toone chance against our getting any cargo at all consigned to them at thisseason of the year even if we offered to carry it gratis 
in the secondplace if it was offered i could easily get out of it in fifty ways 
afterwards when the deplorable accident takes place an inquiry intothis will help to draw off attention from your floridan peninsula 
anyone inclined to carp will instantly be told that we were equally ready toput the specie ashore on the virginian coast if our other cargo had ledus there 
what do you think of that now  beg your pardon 
that s clear-sighted enough and should work correctly 
but i fancy my other objection is better founded 
what in the name ofplague did you go and economize over insurance for 
why didn t you getthe stuff underwritten slap up to the strong-room of the bank  to save 
if you aren t going past the middle of the mexican gulf what is the use of wasting money by insuring further  in a deal of 
a mere straw in a cartload  that my dear mr onslow is business 
as i often assure my youngfriends commencing life if one takes care of the pennies the poundswill take care of themselves 
it is by looking after what you are pleasedto consider trivial sums like these that the firm of marmaduke rivers andshelf has risen to its present eminence  oh wind retorted onslow 
 don t tell me  sir exclaimed shelf 
 well if you will have it the eminence appears to be uncommon tottery and because of your miserable meanness you re doing your best to bring itover 
it s just trifles like this that tell 
consider what will happenafter the catastrophe 
there ll be an inquiry that will lay everythingbare down to the very bed-plates 
do you think they won t jump on thispoint at once 
the stuff is fully insured up to new orleans it isn tinsured on the levee and in the streets where the thefts are notorious 
doesn t this drop an instantaneous hint that it was never intended to getso far  no said shelf sourly 
 i don t see that it does  then retorted onslow i differ from you entirely and as i m to bethe active agent in this affair and have to take the first and gravestphysical risk i do not choose to have my retreat unnecessarily hampered 
i must insist upon your recalling fairfax for additional instructions 
what extra insurance has got to be paid  then pay it yourself angrily exclaimed mr 
shelf 
 that s outside the bargain 
working expenses are your contribution tothe partnership 
and besides for another thing i couldn t plank downthat money if i wished 
i haven t it in the world  mr 
onslow i believe you 
will you extend the same courtesy to me wheni tell you that if i were to attempt raising even such a trivial sum as to-day it would precipitate me into bankruptcy to-morrow  whew 
are you nipped as badly as all that  i have a remorseless drain on me which drinks up the profits of thisbusiness like a great sponge 
it is a domestic drain and i cannot resistit  you poor beggar said onslow with the first scrap of sympathy he hadyet shown to his partner 
 i believe i understand and it tones downyour dingy color 
you aren t quite all black 
i believe by your ownpainting you re only a moderate sort of gray 
and if i ve been beastlyrude and hard with you because i ve considered you a soapy scoundrelplaying entirely for your own hand i ll apologize to you 
that isn t inthe least polite but i think it s plain and perhaps we shall get ontogether better now 
but about this bankruptcy 
it ll be rather a mess ifyou go smash before our florida operation realizes its profits 
it willthicken the inquiry you know to a very unpleasant keenness  i think i shall keep on my feet mr onslow 
i trust i pray i shall and moreover i thank you for what you have said 
i do confess that yourmanner of speech has wounded me much at times  oh as to that returned onslow i mostly say spade when i mean it and i don t care to mix religion with theft when i m talking with aco-conspirator 
but i fancy we understand one another more comfortablynow and i ll leave you to make the rest of the arrangements here inlondon 
this afternoon i ll pick up kettle and run down to liverpool andget things in hand there 
they ll require care 
to begin with there sa suitable armament to be smuggled on board without advertisement 
andthere are other nefarious preparations to be made 
piracy on the highseas is not a thing to be undertaken lightly nowadays nor is murder  oh heavens cried shelf don t speak of these horrors  i speak of them replied onslow grimly because it is right that youshould understand what will probably be done 
i don t intend to redden myfingers if it can be avoided but as i put my neck in jeopardy failureor no failure i naturally don t intend to hesitate at any action whichwill bring unqualified success 
only understand fully mr theodoreshelf that piracy you are already an active sharer in and if there smurder done to boot you will be as guilty as the worst even thoughyou sit here in your snug london offices whilst other rougher men arehandling pistol and knife in the gulf or in a floridan mangrove swamp chapter viii 
the send-off 
the port edes had gained the name of an unlucky ship 
she had slainthree men in her building she had crushed another to death the daybefore she left the slips and though only three years in the water shehad already maimed enough hands from various crews to make her a fullcomplement 
some vessels are this way from no explainable cause thereseems to be a diabolic fatality about them 
it is not to be supposed that sailormen rush to join a craft of thissinister reputation 
although they are called asses in the bulk theyare only asses in part 
they always try for the best berths first 
butbecause there are not enough of these to go round and because thanks tothe dago and the dutchman there are not sufficient berths of any sortwhatever to supply all aspirants it is always possible to man any vesselwhich a board of trade official will pass through a dock gates 
just as no man is ever successful in anything without due cause so per contra few sailormen are down on their luck except through somepeculiar trait of incapacity 
so that on your unpopular ship be shetramp-steamer or eke weeping wind-jammer you do not get much pick of acrew 
you have to put up with what other people have left and it doesnot take you long to learn that your beauties have not been rejected fortheir excellences 
it was this way on the port edes 
forward and aft engine-hold andpantry each man on board of her had his private sea-failings 
betweenthem they lacked wakefulness eyesight decision strength of fist strength of language seamanship and common sobriety 
amongst thedeck-hands there were virulent sea-lawyers in the stokeholds there was mes damn es wanted by several governments 
the engineers were skilfulin gaining the smallest possible knottage per ton of coal the mates wereall slipshod navigators untrustworthy even to correct a compass anduseless to drive a truculent crew 
over all was owen kettle master mariner 
whatever his failings mightbe and the index of them tailed out they did not show prominently atthe head of such a ship s company 
like all men in the merchant marine he had been bred in the roughest school but unlike his successfulbrethren he had not graduated later on to the smooth things of awell-manned passenger liner 
for his sins he had remained the pitifulknock-about skipper a man with knife-edged words always ready on the lipof his teeth a leaden whistle in one jacket-pocket and a lethal weaponin the other 
he was an excellent seaman and navigator a man capable ofgoing an entire voyage without taking off his clothes or enjoying onewatch of regular sleep 
whilst in command at sea he credited himselfwith the powers of a czar and was entirely unscrupulous in gainingends which expediency or his owners laid down for him and though notphysically powerful he had the pluck of a dog and an unholy reputationfor marksmanship 
taking into allowance these qualifications it maybe understood that for the handling of such a menagerie of all-nationscoundreldom and incapacity as bunked in the s s port edes no betterman than owen kettle breathed in either hemisphere 
the crew signed their marks on the articles at the shipping office inthe sailors home and went off grumbling to get rid of their advances 
later most of them turned up on the steamer some with their worldlygoods done up in dunnage sacks which look to the uninitiated likepillow-slips some apparently possessing nothing but the squalid raimentthey stood up in 
there was not one of them dressed like a sailor according to the conventional idea yet most of them had made theirbread upon the seas since early boyhood which shows what conventionalideas are sometimes worth 
they were most of them oldish men and lookedeven older than their years 
the engineers came on board early for the most part in scrubby blueserge and sour black temper 
they grumbled at the mess-room in broadglaswegian prophesied evil in advance about the capacities of themess-room steward and the ship s cook dumped their belongings into theirvarious rooms and changed to apparel more suitable for tail-twisting inthe unclean regions below 
then they went on duty quarreled with thedonkeyman who was making steam for the winches and proceeded to split uptheir crew of firemen and trimmers into watches and apportion them tofurnace doors and bunkers 
the three mates the boatswain and the carpenter were also on boardbetimes most of them large-headed with recent libations and feelingcantankerous accordingly 
there was a small general cargo beingshipped for new orleans and it gave these worthy officers ease tofind occasional acid fault with the stevedore s crew or the crane menon the wharf but for the most part they shuffled about the decks ineasy slippers attending to the various ship duties in massive sneeringsilence 
patrick onslow came into the chart-house on the bridge-deck closing thedoor behind him 
 a cheery amiable crowd you ve collected he said 
 aren t they replied captain kettle from a sofa locker 
 they re justa terror of a crew 
you wait till we get to sea and they start onmischief 
my mate s a cur he wouldn t stand up to a chinaman 
and therest of the after-guard is much of a pattern picked that way on purpose 
oh i tell you mr onslow that i stand alone and i shall have my handsfull 
but let em start the brutes 
i ll haze them 
it isn t a new sortof tea-party this with me  you re going into it with your eyes open anyway  oh don t you make any error sir said kettle 
 i know my job 
and if iwarn you it s because you ll see things for yourself and perhaps joinin at them 
i don t go and tell everybody 
not much 
they think ashorei ve got a real soft thing on this time 
why do you know mr onslow he added with a thin sour grin my old woman wanted to come with mefor the trip 
she said it was so long since she s had a whiff of outsideair that now i d such a tidy steamboat under me she couldn t miss thechance 
yes sir and she said she d bring one of the kids with her thatwanted to be a sailor like his daddy 
i tell you she was that took onthe idea she d hear no refusal and i had to write a letter to owners and get them to wire back a no she could read for herself 
it d lookwell set to music that tale wouldn t it 
sort of jumpy music you know with a yo-heave-humbug chorus to it same as all sailors songs have thatyou hear in the halls onslow shrugged his shoulders 
 what can you expect at the price heasked 
 this isn t a twelve-pound-a-month berth and you ve threshedacross the atlantic in a worse ship for less  don t you mistake me retorted kettle 
 i m working for full valuereceived and there s many an old sailor d like to be in my shoes if heonly knew 
i m not grumbling at the berth only when a man s on a racketof this kind it s a bit hard on him to have a wife and kids he s foolenough to be fond of 
it s an ugly amusement lying to them like a playactor when you know it s ten chances to one you ll never see english mudagain 
that s the way it cuts though i suppose you ll think it all asailor s grumble 
perhaps you aren t a married man  no i m not  but you ve got people who care for you onslow gave the ghost of a smile and then laughed 
 no he said ican t even boast of that 
acquaintances are mine in thousands butfriends well all friendship has its breaking strain 
i m a bit like thatcomfortable contemptible person the miller of the dee 
i believe i didcare for somebody once and she made me think she cared for me 
probablyshe lied because under persuasion she went off with another man 
bah 
though what does it matter 
kettle we re talking rank sentiment andthat s an unprofitable employment for men engaged on a piece of delicatebusiness 
and here s a gentleman come to tell me that the consignment ofspecie is just commencing to arrive 
now captain the stuff ll be iniron-bound boxes and you and i have got to weigh each one separately and check the invoice 
then we re to act as our own stevedores and stowhalf of it in the cabin next my room and half of it across the alley-waynext the mate s  why divide it  because the weight is big and it would give your steamer a heavy listto starboard  oh as to that never mind 
we can easily bring her up again with atrimming tank and i shouldn t feel comfortable if any of the stuff wasin that room next the mate s 
you see mr onslow any one on board cango down that alley-way 
in fact it s the only road from end to end ofthe ship unless you go up over the bridge deck 
and i d not guaranteebut what the bait wouldn t make some of them beauties try and tamperwith the door 
it s big enough to smudge the honesty of an archbishop if he was only earning four pounds a month 
now the room next yours hasiron walls and opens only into the inner cabin 
there s a good lock onit already and if i make the carpenter bend on four more you ll have astrong-room the bank of england might boast about  that sounds sensible commented the envoy from the bank 
 very well said onslow i believe it is the best plan 
now if youplease we ll have the weighing-machine in the main cabin and if you sir will instruct your men to bring in the boxes one by one i llsatisfy myself that they agree with the tally and captain kettle shallbuild them up in the state-room before us both 
it s a very responsiblejob we have upon us and the more counter-checkings and precautions wecan put into it the better for our several reputations it was a responsible job 
not every day is specie to the tune of half amillion british sovereigns shipped from a liverpool dock and becausegold-boxes are made in a conventional pattern the shipment was spotted and crowds gathered to stare at the cased-in wealth 
as staring dumbly is dry work self-appointed orators amongst thecrowd naturally distributed gratis their own private opinions upon thesituation and according to their luck or eloquence these attractedlarger or smaller audiences 
no one took them very seriously and theyfor the most part treated the subject in a jocular vein 
it was not tillcaptain kettle and the mersey pilot had gone on to the upper bridge andthe mate on the fore-deck had cast off the first bow-fast that a prophetarose who spoke of the gold shipment in another key 
he was a wild unkempt knock-kneed man who attracted first attention bytying a crimson handkerchief to an umbrella and brandishing it above hishead 
being on the face of him a creature who never if he could avoidit put his hand to honest labor he naturally addressed the crowd atlarge as fellow workers these things awoke a slight humorous interest and because the man had the gift of glib and striking speech the crowdcontinued to listen after the first pricking up of their ears 
the man s discourse need not be reported in detail 
he was an anarchist red rampant and ruthless and by means of arguments some warped somefair enough he pointed out to his hearers that the mission of the portedes was another knife-thrust of capital into the ribs of labor 
thestatement met with a very mixed reception but the anarchist silencedboth the jeers and the applause with a beseeching wave of his hand andfollowed along the curb of the wharf the steamer which was commencing tofloat towards the dock gates 
he spoke to those on board her now ratherthan to his more immediate following and unclean faces stared at himfrom over the line of bulwarks 
 to any man of you who values life he cried i offer a solemn warning 
that ship is doomed she will sink in mid-ocean blown apart by ourpetards and her ill-gotten cargo will be hurled out of capital s reachforever 
those who are misguided enough to be her guardians will be blowninto space 
listen you men of her crew 
jump on the pier-head yonder asshe passes into the basin and take the consequences 
the brutal laws ofthis country will hurl you into prison but better a season dragging outa martyr s sentence than death as an enemy to the workers cause at this point the strong right hand of the law descended on to thespeaker s elbow and then because he attempted to resist thewilling right knee of the law jerked up suddenly into the small ofthat anarchist s back after which he was haled ignominiously to apolice-station and the place of his speaking knew him no more 
but the fellow s threats had not been without their result 
every handon the port edes deck had heard them distinctly and disquiet aroseunder the belts of nine out of ten 
the mates grew nervous and the meninattentive and from the bridge captain kettle s voice and whistlekept ringing out with biting clearness 
as it was only one man attemptedto put the warning into practical effect 
he was a miserable half-cladwretch a coal-trimmer by rating already repentant of the spell ofphysical toil which he had signed on for 
passing through the lock-gates into the basin the steamer s port quarterswung gently towards the wall 
a sailor in readiness dropped fromabove and ran aft with the lanyard of a cork fender 
the trimmer jumpedon the bulwarks and one might have thought that he was going to beara hand an unnecessary hand 
the sailor did so and cursed him for hisofficiousness 
the donkeyman however who was oiling the after-winch had other ideas on the subject and stood by for a rush 
so it befellwhen that trimmer was getting himself ready for a spring back on thequay-head the donkeyman s long legs took him rapidly across the red irondecks and when the trimmer was already in mid-air the donkeyman s hugepaw descended upon the slack of his black breeches and drew him back asthough he possessed the weight of a feather pillow 
whereat the crowd atthe pier-head yelled with delighted laughter and the dingy steamer madeher way stolidly on to the muddy waters of the mersey ebb which bubbledagainst the lip of the walls beyond 
 curse you snarled the trimmer what s that for  because we re short-manned in the stokehold already me son an ifthere s a hand goes it s meself that ll have to stand watch and watch inhis place 
havin got you i shall be a jintleman now and slape in mybed at night all the way to new orleans 
see that  this mucky old tramp ll be blowed up sure s death and i shall bekilled  well bless me retorted the donkeyman who d miss you if you waskilled always supposing you weren t wanted for our furnaces 
here getup you half-baked scum of the workhouse and tumble below 
thank yourstars the old man hasn t seen you from the bridge 
but don t give me anymore of your lip or i ll report you to him and the chief to boot 
now  mosey the coal-trimmer blew his nose on his gray neck-handkerchief andshambled off below muttering 
the donkeyman returned to his winch unbent the chain and sent it down into the adjacent hold 
then heretired to the poop deck-house where he lived with the carpenter andboatswain and offered to bet those worthies who had just come in fordinner that captain kettle shot some one on board before the port edes tied up against new orleans levee 
 he s a just holy terror our old man observed the donkeymancheerfully 
 i sailed with him once before and he unbent aquartermaster s front teeth with the bridge telescope before we werethree days out 
with the smudgy crowd we ve got here now it s a poundto a brick they start him moving even sooner than that 
not that i mindmyself 
sea s dull enough as a general thing and i like to see a bitof life throwing about 
and at that game little red kettle s good as ayankee skipper any day chapter ix 
ground-bait 
for reasons the port edes took the north about course that is sheheaded across south of the banks of newfoundland nearly to cape hatteras and then braved the three-knot current of the gulf stream by passing downthe florida channel on the western side of the bahamas 
they had carriedgood weather with them light head breezes or calms all the way and although coals were dear and the day s outlay was limited to twenty-eighttons by order the steamer usually averaged ten and a half knots despitethe unskilfulness of the engine-room staff 
in a canvas chair on the bridge deck under the lee of the fiddley satpatrick onslow with a pipe between his teeth and pierre loti s fant med orient in his lap 
he was distinctly idling 
for the moment he waswondering how from so transparently blue a sea the spray which jumpedfrom the wave-crests could be colorless and opaque 
then by followingwith the eye a tangle of yellow gulf weed which floated past hisattention was carried away to some little gray spouts of fog whichtold of whales and their calves taking a summer outing in the milk-warmwaters of the south 
beyond his eyes fell upon one of the screw-pilelighthouses with which the united states government has fringed theflorida shoal and on the far horizon sprouted the wind-threshed tops ofsome scattered cabbage palms which told that there at least the shallowsea was sea no more 
at the back of these palms lay the mysteriousshelter of the everglades 
a thought passed through patrick onslow s mind a thought of the dramato be played under shelter of those recesses within the next few days and he frowned 
he thrust the thought from him as an impertinence andturned again to his novel 
but he was destined just then to read no morefrom that dainty vignette of stamboul 
through the grating of the fiddleyabove his head came a frightened shout then a chorus then a prolongedclattering as iron tools were thrown on the floor-plates and the bootsof scared men smote the rungs of the ladders 
onslow gave a quick smile to himself as though he understood something then mounted a look of concern on his face and getting up from hischair crossed to port and strode up to the break of the bridge-deck 
the captain coming out of the chart-house joined him 
from the doorof the alley-way beneath them rushed a crowd of frightened men trimmersand stokers stripped to the waist engineers in dungaree all the humancontents of the lowest hold 
kettle singled out the chief with his eye and addressed him with sour irony  afternoon mr mcfee 
fine isn t it for the time of year 
have yourcurs forgotten that they re paid to work this steamboat up mississippiriver to a city called new orleans 
or have they induced the other watchto go below and give them a spell  guid god sir dinna jest replied the chief 
 ye remember what yon scoundrel said on liverpool dock wall 
weel he sbeen as guid as his words sir 
we ve found an infernal machine already  well drawled kettle 
 man we may be blown to the sea-floor any minute  sea whisky 
sea grandmother  man sir see wi your own een 
by god s guid mercy the donkeyman pickedit from among the coals or it s no knowin where we d bin this blessedmoment  hand it up here the skipper commanded shortly 
the burly donkeyman half grinning half afraid came up the iron stepsand handed the captain a box painted to look like a knob of coal 
 it was ticking when i picked it up sir he said but when i handledit the ticking stopped the captain took the thing in his hand 
it started on a fresh cluck  cluck and the grimy men on the iron decks below humped their shouldersas though to better receive a blow and began to shuffle away towards thebows 
 oh it may be something dangerous said captain kettle and he hove hisburden over the side or it mayn t 
looked to me like a toy to frightenflats 
there s only one man with the pluck of a roach amongst you andhere s half-a-crown for him the donkeyman s black forefinger knuckled his greasy cap 
 as for the rest your mothers must have suckled you on pigeons milk and then sent you to a girls school to dry-nurse 
you pack of beauties 
oh you cowardly bobby-hunted gems 
if the thing was found well foundit was and the donkeyman brought it on deck 
what do you want to foulthe clean air for with your dingy stinking carcasses before your watchwas out 
i ll log every man of you for this yes mr mcfee and mr second and mr third i ll dirty your tickets for you as well and ifyou give me another ounce of bother i ll take care you none of you everget another berth so long as the universe holds water to carry shipping 
you cowardly hounds 
oh you trust me the men slunk back into the alley-way again out of shot of the skipper stongue and the engineers plucking up courage first led the way below 
some one clattered a shovel on a firebar 
instinct made the trimmers obeythe signal and they went to the bunkers 
the firemen followed and thesteam-gauge remounted before it had received any appreciable check 
itwas all an affairs of five minutes 
kettle passed a forefinger round the inside of his shirt-collar andstrolled across with onslow to where the deck-chairs straddled in theshade of the fiddley 
 they re a holy crew aren t they said the masterof the port edes 
 i think they re what we want 
we should be rather out of it with aplucky lot who insisted on standing by us at a pinch  oh don t you make any error about that replied kettle 
 they d havebeen shaky anyway but this bogus clockwork devil of yours fixes them toa nicety 
it ll be every jack for himself when the scare comes and davyjones take the steamer and the others 
oh they ll run like a warren ofrabbits 
the brutes kettle broke off abruptly and stared moodily over the gulf stream 
aflying-fish got out of the blue water and ran across the ripples like asilver rat 
a school of porpoises snorted leisurely up from astern andpassed the steamer as though she had been at anchor 
and the tangles ofthe gulf-weed floated past like reefs of tawny coral 
 do you ever read poetry the skipper suddenly asked 
onslow slewed round his head and stared 
the idea of this vinegar-mouthedlittle savage talking of poetry very nearly made him break into wildlaughter 
with an effort he steadied his face and said quietly  sometimes  i m glad of that 
somehow i hadn t dared ask you before but now i know mr onslow i like you all the better 
it gives us something in commonwe can talk about without being ashamed 
we can t very well discuss theother matter which binds us together and respect ourselves at the sametime  quite right 
you and i captain are shouldered to common piracy by theforce of circumstances but i always kick myself when i think about it 
there s no glamour of romance about our intended villainy or the wayit s being led up to  not a bit 
byron wrote about piracy but byron was no seaman and hedidn t know what hazing a crew meant 
a thief s a dirty scoundrel allthe world over and always has been and a sea thief having the scum ofthe earth to handle has to make himself the crudest brute on earth ifhe wants to succeed 
i think it s that which put me out of liking withbyron and all those poets who ve written about movement at sea 
they givea wrong idea of men s motives and actions and when they get talking onshop they re that inaccurate and absurd they make one tired 
no mr onslow give me a land poet who talks about farms and primroses andtinkling brooks and things he understands and with that man i can sitthrough two watches on end 
reading him may make me feel low but itdoesn t do a man harm to be that way sometimes 
ye see mr onslow ascuffle or a row with a mutinous crew is just meat and drink to me 
yes sir that s the kind of brute i am they chatted and basked during the rest of the afternoon whilst the twomates off watch painted ironwork and the crew off duty grumbled andsmoked and slept in the stuffy forecastle 
the cabin tea came 
kettle at the head of the table preserved a sour silence and onslow and themates carried amongst them a strained civility 
and then skipper andsupernumerary officer returned to their canvas chairs beside the fiddleyon the bridge-deck 
the gulf stream rippled crisply over the steamer s wake astern and thesmall wavelets of a calm licked the yellow rust-stains which patched hersweeping flank 
before them the narrow sea was the color of a dull blueroofing-slate 
the bright hot day had faded the brilliant cobalt hadfiltered away from overhead and a silver nail-paring of moon peered froma sky of amorphous violet still lighted in its higher flats by the sun safter-glow 
on the horizon line was what at first appeared to be a steamer s smoke but what the glass showed to be the reek of a fire on the invisible low-lying florida coast 
no blaze-glow could be seen 
it might be afisher s camp-fire on an outlying key it might be a game-driving ofseminole indians beyond the explored coast-fringe in that unknown tangleof trees and grasses and lagoons the everglades themselves 
 it s worth living mr onslow times like these said kettle when theyhad sat there in silence till the warm night had spread all over and thewhite stars were beginning to show in multitudes through its gaps 
the other nodded sucking at his cold pipe 
 none of those poets haveever put all this down on paper 
they ve got parts bits but not all 
ifancy it is because they haven t seen the thing for themselves 
i vetried myself but i haven t made much account of it  what you you re a poet onslow rapped out 
 i knock off a bit of verse occasionally said the skipper complacently 
 when i m in the mood that is 
it generally comes times like this wheni ve been tail-twisting the hands and have a spell of a rest and a thinkafterwards  i see the outcome of the vivid contrast said onslow 
he imaginedto himself that these boasted poems would be of the heroic order to the verge of melodrama 
as it happened he could not convenientlyhave made a worse guess 
kettle lugged from his pocket a doubled-upexercise-book reddened slightly under the tan and handed it across 
hiscompanion flattened out the crease and in the light which came from achart-house port dipped into the manuscript verses for himself 
to hisastonishment they were one and all sonnets and ballads which might wellhave been written by a sentimental schoolgirl 
they breathed of love anddevotion and premature fading away and at least three gushing adjectivesqualified each tender noun 
there was no word about the sea on which their author had spent hislife or of the things of the sea with which he had had all hisdealings 
he knew about these as few men did but they seemed commonto him and unclean 
consequently he had delivered himself of an odeto that spring which he had never witnessed ashore and love songs toladies he had never met outside the covers of cheap fiction 
it was allimagination and untutored uninspired imagination at that 
as a result onslow found the poems too killingly funny for words andwas consumed with a wild desire for laughter but with that red-beardedlittle savage their maker glaring anxiously at him from the oppositeshadow he dare not let so much as the tail of a smile dance from thecorner of his mouth 
he had to enjoy and endure in silence and with theexercise-book thrust out to the yellow light-stream he read on throughthe stanzas diligently 
in one evidently autobiographical the writer spoke of himself as a timid frail gazelle in another he addressed his remarks from themouth-piece of a coy and cooing turtle-dove to a sylphlike maiden ofhaughty mien who at the time of the narration was the bewitching entrancing unparalleled queen of another gentleman s hearth 
an odeto excellence which commenced hairy alfred brother bard wasevidently directed at a contemporary but the past was cared for in cleopatra a lament which a footnote stated could be sung to the tuneof greenland s icy mountains probably as a collection captain kettle s was unique in its clumsy maudlin sentiment and its general unexpectedness 
meanwhile the author was fidgeting nervously 
he had not got overthat initial nervousness which publication gives 
he hungered for acriticism favorable if possible 
at last he made bold to ask for it 
 you re a wonderful man kettle returned his companion quite meaningwhat he said and unless i had seen those verses for myself i d neverhave believed you capable of producing them no matter what had been toldme about your powers the poet gave a sigh of relief and was going to pursue the subjectfurther when something fell upon his ear which turned his thoughts intoa very different key 
 by james 
there s the engine stopped 
what s up now i wonder he jumped to his feet and stood with neck craned out listening 
thering of heavy boots made itself heard on the engine-room ladders 
thenthere was a murmur of voices and a pattering of footsteps from theforecastle and presently a stream of men began to ascend the bridge-deckladders 
amongst the growing babel of voices came references to the gold  half a million yellow sovereigns boys and threats there was nomistaking 
 teach the old man manners or put him over the side by an evident previous arrangement the men were massing themselves on theport side of the bridge deck 
 mutiny by james that s what this means commented captain kettle inan undertone 
he was cool as ice and on the moment had decided how to act 
 now mr onslow slip into the chart-house for your pistol 
i have minein my pocket 
it s us two against the crowd of em and we ll finish outtop side 
oh don t you make any error it ll be a red night s work forthose dogs 
but we ll rub the fear of death into them before we ve donethis time into those that are left that is 
get your pistol quick sir and skin your eye for handy shooting chapter x mutiny 
patrick onslow came out of the chart-house with all the armament he couldlay hands upon to wit three revolvers 
he gave one to the captain andput the others in his own jacket pocket so that they had a brace apiece 
from the other side of the bridge-deck the clamor of the men rose highinto the night and the steamer s fore-truck began to swing past thestars 
her engines had stopped the quartermaster had deserted the wheel and the gulf stream was taking her as simple flotsam whither it listed 
there was no starboard ladder to the upper bridge but kettle swunghimself lightly up by a funnel-stay and a stanchion and climbed overthe canvas dodger 
onslow followed as nimbly 
the mate of the watchreceived them with a frightened sidelong glance but no words and thenhe vanished into the darkness 
captain owen kettle stumped cheerfully across to the port side of thebridge and looked down 
beneath him massed and moving was apparentlyevery man of his crew 
the electric lamp from inside the head of thecompanion-way blazed full upon them dazzling some of the group andblinding the others with dense black shadow 
with folded arms he lookeddown on them for a full minute with a silent sneering laugh tillthe upturned faces which had been quiet in expectation began to growclamorous again 
then he waved them to noiselessness and spoke 
the man s words were not conciliatory 
he addressed his hearers as dogs and wished to know in the name of the pit why they had dared to leavetheir duties and their kennel to come to sully his bridge-deck 
the harangue was brief and beautifully to the point 
an ordinary seamanstood out into the middle of the circle of light and made reply yougall us togs und you dreat us as togs und we re nod going to schtandtit no longer 
this grew temants its rechts  hallo said kettle got a blooming dutchman to speak for you 
well you must be a hard-up crowd 
see here now if you do want to talk haveyour say and be done with it 
english is the official language on thisship understand that and don t waste my time the german seemed inclined to bluster and hold his ground but he had nobackers 
 if you re undecided suggested captain kettle you ve got a niggeramongst you why not set him on to talk 
if you were men i wouldn t sayit but he s as much a man as any of you and perhaps he ll throw in asand-dance to enliven proceedings the negro from somewhere on the outskirts of the crowd broke intoa loud guffaw till some one kicked him on the shins and sent himaway yelping diminuendo into the farther darkness 
an angry growlwent up from the white men at the taunt and one of them a whiskeredquartermaster in a cardigan jacket stepped out and spat into the circleof light 
he looked round to catch the encouraging glances of his mates and then lifted up his face towards the upper bridge 
 see here captainkettle you d better not try us too far 
this isn t a slave ship you recommanding 
it s a common low-down british tramp and the law looksafter the deck-hands and all the rest of us  now that s fair speaking said kettle 
 i ve a profound respect forthe merchant shipping act and all the rest of the laws 
my lad if youfancy you ve anything to complain of a sea-lawyer like you must know theremedy 
get your witnesses and go with them before the british consul innew orleans  a fat lot of good that would do retorted the man 
 what consul everbelieved an old sailor against the skipper 
no sir we d only getpenitentiary for our pains 
besides what we want and what we intend tohave is an alteration in things beginning now  ah 
i see 
and what would you like 
shall i have a hold cleared out andfit up with four-post beds for you to make a drawing-room of 
shall iorder my steward to hand iced pop round to the gentlemen who are heavin coals in the stokehold 
come now out with it the little captain was deliberately irritating the men and onslowmarveled at his recklessness 
once let an outbreak start and he andkettle stood not one chance in a million of living through it 
but kettleknew his game and was playing it well 
only one man laughed and his laugh closed up again in a moment like thesnap of a watch 
some scowled a few swore the quartermaster in thecardigan jacket alone remained unmoved 
of kettle s outrageous railleryhe took no notice whatever but continued his plaint in a solid monotone as though he had been reading it from a book 
 in the first instance it s the grub we complains of partic ly thesugar 
it ain t sugar at all it s just a slump of molasses  that said kettle is due to your own laziness 
the bottom of a sugarbarrel s always that way unless you turn it end for end every day or so 
the molasses d settle through the queen s sugar at windsor and spoilhalf of it unless the barrel was looked to 
by james he continued witha first show of fury is it for this you dogs have turned yourselvesinto a howling pack of mutineers and let my ship drift like a hen-cooptowards newfoundland the quartermaster was obviously disconcerted by the attack so much so in fact that he missed the next few counts of his indictment and cameat once to the main head 
 it s a rise of wages that we insists on principally he said 
 wetake it we ve been signed on for this run to new orleans under falsepretenses 
nothing was said about the sort of cargo we was to carry which naturally incites them anarchist chaps to vi lence 
we resuffering undue risks 
there s been one devil machine found already andas like as not there is others besides 
the bloomin ole tramp may go upany minute and because we re standing that risk we say we ought to bepaid accordin 
the cargo can stand the pull and if you aren t willing the hands here has made up their minds to broach it for themselves kettle did not answer at once 
he seemed to be twisting words over andover in his mouth and then gulping them down his throat and bringingup others 
it was a full minute before the man found speech but thenit came from him in a torrent 
 you great fools he cried this isn tan ordinary cargo that you can help yourselves out of and let theunderwriters stand treat 
you bet the tallyman won t wink at any yarnabout damaged in transit over the stuff we re bringing out 
if there sso much as a miserable half-sovereign missing the whole crowd here cookand captain s dog stay in a new orleans calaboose till it s found andthen come out with their tickets dirtied 
oh 
you one-eyed mutton-headedfools onslow stared at the man curiously 
his truculent tone had left himcompletely 
his hands had quitted the pistol-butts and were gripped onthe bridge rail 
his elbows were beating nervously against his ribs 
from some mouth in the blacker shadow came a deep derisive laugh andthen a voice presumably from the laugher said who wants to go to neworleans 
who wants to go nearer than the next key or reef or sandbank or whatever it may be 
let s pile up the blazing old tramp on that andthen boat-cruise across to cuba 
there s nice snug bays in cuba wherethe guardacostas don t ask questions or if they did a bit of yellowballast out of the boats would stop their jaws quick enough the voice laughed again and ceased 
 who spoke there captain kettle demanded 
out rolled into the bright circle the massive body of the donkeyman 
 you the donkeyman knuckled his greasy cap in assent 
 i m your man capt n he said but i d be pleaseder to help yecarrying out the crew s wishes than going agin them 
you ll be dealt byhonustly capt n liberally yes better than ye ever have been in thisworld yet or ever will be again an the steamer will be lost at say 
blowed to rivuts an ould iron by a conspirathor s bomb 
it s a mostnatural ending for her kettle stared at the donkeyman with his mouth agape and the eyesstanding out of his head 
his face was thrust out at full neck s length his fingers beat a vague tattoo on the white iron rail of the bridge 
then the crew s original spokesman lifted up his unlucky voice for thesecond time ach vriends we re vasting minutes 
we haf made up ourmindts 
why should we not go und tivide ter cold mitout furder pother 
cood ole man 
come and sgramble for a share like ter rest of us slowly captain kettle stiffened 
his eyes lost their stare and glintedunpleasant fire in their more proper orbits his lower jaw closed up witha snap his fists slid to his jacket pockets and gripped there 
 you painted dutchman the crew rustled uneasily 
 do i live to hear a set of dogs like you dictating to me 
does any manhere think he s going to have an inch of his own way aboard of me  come captain kettle said the quartermaster who had talked before  don t be unreasonable 
the dutchman means well though he didn t put itbristol fashion 
and besides we ve made up our minds to share in thatgold and you d better chip in and share too without a dust 
it ll bea deal comfortabler for all hands and besides it s got to be done anyway 
we re all determined and we re too many for you even if mr onslow does stand in on your side kettle s face lit up with the joy of battle 
 are you by james hesnapped 
 we ll see about that 
i d handle twice your number to my owncheek any day 
i done it before on a dashed sight uglier lot than you and came out top side and i m going to do it again now 
mr onslow swith me too this time and we ve got twenty bullets amongst us that llall go home in somebody s ribs before any of you get at hand-grips withus 
now just play on that you scum 
there s not a one of you got apistol  oh 
haven t we commented a nasal voice on the outskirts of the crowd  i guess you re out there mister 
i m heeled for one  crack the man shrieked and fell in a limp heap on the deck 
his weaponclattered down beside him 
kettle kept his smoking pistol-muzzle raisedsteady as an iron wrist could hold it 
the others instinctively drew at first away from the fallen man but oneordinary seaman younger and more plucky than the rest darted forwardto regain the fallen revolver 
as his fingers closed over it his eyesinstinctively sought the bridge 
onslow had his revolver sighted over thecrook of an elbow kettle his at arm s length 
both were covering him 
 fling that thing overboard or you ll be dead before you can wink the crew s only revolver span through the air and hit the water with atinkling splash 
 now stand forward the two fools who have been your spokesmen the crowd stood like men petrified 
 quick or i ll make practise into the brown of you the quartermaster in the cardigan jacket stepped out of his own accord undefiant now and white 
the german was hustled to his side 
 have you got a coin quartermaster  no sir  have you sausage  yes herr  then spin it up and do you quartermaster call to him 
and mind youcall right because i m going to shoot the loser and perhaps you are theleast useless of the two 
spin confound you 
spin sausage or by jamesi ll shoot you where you stand and settle it that way the german put something between his dished palms and shook it violently then clinched one hand and thrust it out into the full blaze of thelamplight 
the quartermaster cried head the other unwrapped his grimy fingerswith slow jerks and showed 
the coin was a halfpenny britanniauppermost 
the quartermaster buttoned his cardigan jacket and drewhimself up to face the upper bridge 
 hold up your hand it shot up to the full length fingers splayed out 
then crack anda bullet ripped through the middle of the palm 
the fellow let out ashort yelp of surprise and clapped the wounded member tightly under hisarmpit 
the men around him utterly cowed stood in frozen silence andcaptain owen kettle from the bridge waved slow patterns over them with arevolver muzzle 
then he crammed both weapons into his jacket pockets again and gaveorders sharply crisply and with decision 
 watch below get forward and turn in 
watch on duty go to your posts 
quartermaster of the watch tumble up here 
sou -west and by sou a quartermaster ran briskly up the bridge ladder 
 s -west and by sou it is sir he replied 
it was the only comment anyof the crew made to captain kettle on his method 
chapter xi 
to-night 
another day and another sky 
now the blue gulf waters were as leaden anddense as that one looks upon in a hard north sea gale and the heavensoverhead were full of lurid grays which raced one another in slidingchase till they were lost in the northern mist drifts 
the steamer rolledheavily to a steep beam sea and when it could be seen the iron of herlower decks forward and aft gleamed as though it had been new-coatedwith ocher varnish 
but this was not often for four minutes out of everyfive the decks were filled with a clamoring hissing pond of green andcotton-white which the scuppers could only empty piecemeal 
the time was evening twenty hours after the quelling of the mutiny and the three tenants of the upper bridge were the only human beingson any of the outer decks 
on the midship grating stood a high-heeledquartermaster holding on to the spokes of the steam wheel browsing onplug tobacco and keeping his eyes mechanically fixed on the jumpingcompass card 
alternately climbing and descending athwartships as thebridge swung under him the third mate took his sea constitutional inrubber thigh-boots with hands thrust into the waistbelt of his breeches 
as officer of the watch every time he passed the binnacle he faced frontand took a regulation peer round the foggy line of horizon with an utterlack of interest 
he was an elderly man the third mate and the sea heldno more surprises for him and no more interest and no more pleasures 
if ever he had ambition he had lost it years since 
his aim in life wasto hold a position of small responsibility and earn a monthly wage withthe smallest possible outlay of exertion either mental or physical 
the remaining occupant of the bridge sat on a camp-stool under the lee ofthe weather dodger with his red peaked beard on his chest his slipperedfeet stuck out in front his elbows crooked out behind him and handsdeep in his jacket pockets 
every time the third mate s footsteps nearedhim his eyes opened and for an instant flashed round to the right-handangle of their orbits 
between whiles he slept 
it was owing to thisfaculty of literally snatching moments of rest that captain kettle atthe end of his twenty hours spell on the upper bridge was as fresh asthough he had just got up from a clear night s sleep 
this watchfulnesswas necessary for as the experienced skipper was quite aware fullyhalf the hands would have gladly tossed him overboard if they could havegrappled him without danger to themselves 
presently however he dropped his doze with a snap and slewed round toface the head of the bridge ladder entirely wakeful 
a head showed itself black-haired with a clean-shaven bright determined face 
the corresponding body followed lean tall muscular 
 ah mr onslow you ve brought me some provender 
thanks indeed 
what 
sandwich and tea 
couldn t be better  i have whisky in my pocket  not for me now 
wait till we get ashore and then i ll booze with anyman to his heart s content 
the game i m on now is like a boat-race if aman wants to win he s got to diet himself the third mate to show to any chance onlooker that he was not insympathy with the unpopular captain planted himself in the angle of thelee dodger which was the greatest distance that the ties of duty wouldallow him to depart 
kettle with an acid grin drew his companion sattention to this move 
 what ll that chap do to-night when the fun begins  bolt like a rat with the first alarm 
he d show pluck if he was paid forit would my third mate but not being paid he ll take the best carepossible of his own ugly hide 
he isn t a fellow who d ever like a tightcorner for its own sake 
there s not an atom of the sportsman about him onslow laughed 
 you re just the other way captain kettle s face clouded 
 it s a fact he said 
 times i am that way cursemy cantankerous luck  your weakness in that direction came in handily for me yesterday  you re right mr onslow right all through 
by george i d half a mindto chip in with these rogues and grab what i could 
it was a temptingchance and it would have been a deal more profitable to me than what i min for now 
as for the honesty of the thing there wasn t a pin to choosebetween it and this racket of yours and mr shelf s 
but it was thatdutchman s gall that put me off 
if he d held his silly jaw and if thoseother bladder-heads had let me understand i was to hold the pistol-handover them well the port edes would have coral rock spouting throughher bottom plates this minute and i d be a man owning a matter of threeto five thousand pounds 
that s putting it straight  so said onslow i suppose i have to thank the said dutchman forcarrying a sound windpipe this minute  no replied kettle thoughtfully i don t think it 
i fancy you d havebehaved reasonable over the new deal and then i d have stood by you 
especially he added slowly as though from after-thought especiallyif those dogs thought that you d have been safer out of the way 
what he asked with a sudden frown as though the subject annoyed him whathave you been doing with yourself this afternoon  physicking a sick fireman principally 
the stokehold temperature was degrees and as he amused himself drinking condensed water by the quarttogether the somewhat natural consequence was cramp in the stomach 
theysent him up by the ash-lift and your steward dosed him with chlorodyneand laudanum and tincture of rhubarb 
the result wasn t encouraging  oh there s never any knowing what to do with a sick stoker s inside 
but one of those drugs ought to have fetched him  perhaps one did but the other two didn t seem to fit his ailment  well he had them for nothing so i don t see what call he had tocomplain 
i never saw such a crew for physic 
they ve drunk that bigchest half dry as it is and if i d let em they d have drunk it threetimes over 
what did you do to the chap 
fill him up on the same again or try a pill 
there s ten sorts of pills in that chest beauties someof them 
you should have tried him on those little silver-coated chapsmarked c they re regular twisters  well you see he was twisted enough already poor devil and if ithadn t been for the donkeyman holding him he d have been overboardthrough the ash-shoot to be rid of his misery 
so as it was i gave him atumblerful of raw whisky and that seemed gradually to untie him againout of his knots the captain snorted 
 you re greener than i thought mr onslow 
if we dbeen going on you d have had half the crew sick on your hands for a doseof that kind 
they re bad enough after sour square doctor s physic butfor a tumbler of liquor and a spell of idleness an old sailor would havean ear and three toes cut off any day 
however he added rising stifflyto his feet and stretching the chief and donkeyman ll see he doesn tmalinger for long 
they are none of them sweet on doing another man swork that gang 
heigh-ho 
see that line of surf we re bringing over thelee quarter  the tortugas  the dry tortugas 
there s a yankee convict station on one of them  don t mention it kettle grinned 
 we shall have made enough westing soon and then ourcourse will be pretty nearly due north so as to dodge the gulf stream asmuch as possible and he added in a lower tone to get the ship asnear as may be to your channel into florida before we jettison the crew  we shall run into the ship tracks from all the northern gulf ports toeurope  i know and we must take our chance of not being spotted 
for a westernsea there s a regular string of traffic tailing down to the dry tortugas 
there you are for one 
look at that old wind-jammer he jerked with his thumb towards a green-painted wooden italian barque which was squattering past less than a quarter of a mile away rightathwart the last rays of the windy sunset 
she was driving merrilyhomewards sending her bows into it till the seas creamed against hercat-heads and darkened her jibs with brine up more than half theirheight 
she was methodically reducing sail and a dozen many-hued picturesque tatterdemalions were aloft on the fore-topgallant yardhammering the struggling canvas into the gaskets 
 the cowardly dagos said kettle that s always their way 
snug downto topsails as soon as it gets dark even if there s only a cat s-pawblowing 
by james 
with a breeze like this i d be carrying royals on thatold tub 
and yet he went on with his beard in the heel of his fist and his eyes gazing out over the tumbling waters and yet they say thereused to be poetry in a craft of that sort whilst there never was andnever will be with a steamer 
i suppose the reason is that a poet hasto be a man who knows nothing whatever about what he writes upon 
i knowthat some chaps who string verses nowadays have been on a steamboat andsmelt the smells of her and seen her lines and watched the men who dothe work and yet they make no poetry about it 
but of the old crew whowrote about moaning harbor-bars and fair white pinions and lusty woodenwalls and trusty hearts of oak why they knew no more about the thingthan a london bobby does of angels 
and that i suppose was why theirstuff is called poetry and the lubberly old wind-jammers poetical 
yougive me a smart steamboat mr onslow there s all the romance on her anold sailorman s got any use for and he understands it too even if hecan t put it down on paper  i believe you re right said onslow thoughtfully and some day a newdana or a new michael scott will come ashore from the upper bridge or from an electric-lighted forecastle or from a forced-draughtengine-room and show it to us plainly whereupon we shall swear that wesaw it for ourselves all along 
but he went on with a sudden frown  for the present let that drift 
you and i have enough to think of in ourimmediate present without speculating over a possible prophet which is toarise  we have but so much must be arranged by the chance of the moment thati don t see we can do much good by talking it over now 
all arrangementsthat can be made ahead i fancy we ve got fixed up already 
by the way i suppose you are sure that your explosion in the forehold won t be toobig 
it would be an awkward do for us if the old ship s bottom was reallyblown out in sober earnest the sun had gone entirely out by this time and the young moon wassailing high amid scurrying cloud-banks 
in the white and shifting light patrick onslow s face looked pale and anxious 
 you re sure kettle repeated it won t be a case of the engineer beinghoisted with his own thingammy  no i m not sure and that s what bothers me 
you see one couldn tquite get an expert to measure out the precise necessary dose and i vehad to guess at it 
i daren t undercharge my bomb 
if our explosion was afizzle and the crew didn t get scared and run why then they d take herup to new orleans whether we liked it or not and she d be examined 
thenthat intake valve couldn t be missed and it couldn t be explained away 
man as you know the thing s as big as a sluice-gate  all the bilge pumps in the gulf of mexico couldn t make headway againstthat valve once it was fairly opened 
it s the quickest and cleverestway of scuttling a steamboat i ever heard of or read about 
but i don tquite see how the valve is going to be turned  you leave that to me  you seem used to the game said kettle with a half sneer 
 no i m not returned the other quickly 
 i ve never had my fingers inanything so ugly or so dirty before and because i don t want to havethe experience over again i m going to make this turn to a big profit or get killed in the trying 
i m tired and sick of this wild bucketinglife 
a woman drove me to it but i believe if i had the means to settledown in comfort now i could forget all about her and wake up other newinterests  well said kettle i hope we may each of us buy a farm out of thisracket but i tell you straight i m not over sweet on the chances 
tobegin with you and i can t handle this steamboat alone 
it s an absolutecertainty we must have another hand to help us 
you ll have to takethe wheel and pilot her through if you can though that s a mighty bigjob for one man and the odds are about ten to one you ll pile her upsomewhere 
i ve got to be below 
at a pinch i might drive the engines though i don t know much of the trade but i can t do that and fire sixtwo-hole boilers and wheel coals out of the bunkers as well 
now ithink the donkeyman is the chap we want 
he understands his way aboutdown there he s as strong as a winch and i fancy he knows which sidehis biscuit s margarined  yes i m with you there 
we ll have the donkeyman if he ll come  then why not sound him now  because i ll hint of this infernal scheme to no one till it s fairlyablaze 
man 
if a ghost s whisper of it got about the crew would riseand grab us pistols or no pistols 
they have that amount of scare inthem they d walk straight up to a maxim gun 
they d trample us out ofexistence before we could fairly look round 
no my neck itches enough asthings are at present and if another on board now besides you knew whatwas going to be done to-night i should feel a bowline noose inside mycollar with half a dozen hangmen beginning to tug at it  see here mr onslow said the shipmaster are you getting sorry youcame out on this trip the other laughed harshly 
 sorry 
whatever have you got in your headnow 
if i do a thing i do it with my eyes open and i make a point ofnever indulging in useless regrets afterwards 
no captain kettle i mgoing through with this matter whether it succeeds or it fails whetherit is brought about without injury to a single human soul or whetherit costs the last pant of breath for every one in this ship 
but i ownto you i am nervous 
the only things which we can be sure will happen are the unexpected and we can t prepare for those and the want ofpreparation may ruin us  it s a big gamble assented kettle and i wish i could say may thelord defend the right but i can t and you can t and least of all shelf can t 
it s a devil s job anyway and he don t always stand by hismen 
the only thing is even nick can t diddle my wife and kids out ofthe insurance i made for them so personally speaking i don t much carewhat happens 
you go below to your room now and get a caulk of sleep 
you ll want it 
and first if you please i ll shake hands with you 
we ve never done it before because a nod s been enough other times butthis is different 
you re a decentish sort and i fancy if that womanhadn t meddled you wouldn t have been shipmates here with me to-night they exchanged a quick handgrip each looking rather ashamed of himself and then onslow went down the bridge ladder whistling and owen kettleresettled himself on his camp-stool 
when next they met the tragedy ofthe port edes would have begun and in it perhaps both would die by anyout of ten violent deaths 
chapter xii 
a dereliction 
eight bells midnight 
the look-out in the crow s-nest forward chanted his last melancholy all s well and gave way to the relief from the next watch 
he climbeddown by the cleats in the iron mast and went to the starboard door inthe forecastle 
other men followed him jumping like cats along thestreaming decks and others came a little later dingy fellows withneckclouts like dishcloths who went in at the port door these lastbeing the goats of shipboard the firemen and trimmers who were dividedoff from the more high-caste deck-hands by a fore-and-aft bulkhead 
the third mate and the quartermaster too from the upper bridge werereplaced by another quartermaster and another mate and they also wentto the places appointed for them and the snores of their breathing soonrattled against the bunk coamings 
only two men on the port edes whowere not on the roster of duty stood that windy morning s first watch 
under the lee of the canvas shelter captain kettle sat huddled on hiscamp-stool in a style which no man could distinguish with certaintybetween wakefulness and sleep and below in his room which opened offthe main cabin and was next the treasure-chamber patrick onslow wasdabbling in something which the laws of nations would stigmatize asfelony and that of complex degree 
there were two berths in the room the upper one against the windowport which he slept in and the lower which contained two spread-outportmanteaus 
beneath this last were drawers in which the captain ssteward kept table linen disused corks the carpet which the chart-housesported in harbor and other articles of ship s use 
onslow had two ofthese drawers out on the floor and from the recess of their site haddrawn two fine green-silk-covered wires 
he disentangled the coils taking care to avoid a kink and thenunscrewed the porcelain switch which governed the room s electric lamp 
beneath were certain pieces of metal embedded in vulcanite 
patrick onslow gave his arms a preliminary stretch a bare wire terminusin each hand 
his fingers were trembling as whose would not have been inthe same situation 
he noticed it and commented to himself on the circumstance that sexcitement i suppose excitement pure and understandable 
not being aman of stone i can t help being thrilled with the majesty of the moment the sublime vagueness of my knowledge of what will happen when a currentflashes through these wires 
i m not a coward 
people who write aboutother men s feelings when death is beginning to paw them on the shoulder write mostly from the imagination and so far as i ve seen they all doit wrong 
i ve been there i ve felt the old man s bony touch more thanonce and so i know 
a man isn t of necessity terrified phantoms of hispast deeds do not invariably flash before him nor does he always losehis nerve and move like a cheap automaton 
i can t speak for others but what i personally have felt has been a dull carelessness for whatis going to happen and a curiosity about what will come afterwards 
itseems to me that a thinking man with the ambition of a mouse shouldnever fear death because once dead he becomes wiser than all the livingremnant of the human race 
there are men i know whom physical dangerturns into a helpless mass of palpitating nerves 
shelf for instance is one of those 
by jove he smiled grimly by jove 
i d give a fingerto have theodore shelf in my shoes just now and force him to couplethese wires and spring the mine with his own fat white fingers 
ibelieve yes i verily believe the experience would turn him honest 
ah there goes one bell 
time s up through a lull in the wind the tenor clang of the ship s bell camedown to him and on its heels more dimly the look-out s dissyllabicassurance in the dismal minor key that he was awake and had nothing toreport 
then patrick onslow made connection and sent through the green-silkcovered wires a current direct from the steamer s dynamo and on thatmoment was thrown against the iron roof of the state room as though theinfernal machine had exploded beneath his very feet 
 the camp-stool was kicked into the air the wet canvas dodgers shed waterin streams and captain owen kettle fell spread-eagled on the plankingof the bridge 
from the hatch in the fore-deck before him had sprunga volcano of ruddy flame spurting through vast billows of smoke theiron plating round it buckled and split and the whole steamer gave atrembling frightened leap 
presently from the black windy night above there fell an avalanche of d bris which smote the steamer and the waterround like canister-shot from a distant cannonade 
then came a thumping jar from the engine-room repeated twice over andthen the engines stopped 
 my god thought kettle he s overshot the mark 
if she s broken down we re done for but for all that he did not lose for an instant his presence of mind orinstinct of command but picking himself up clapped a stumpy leadenwhistle between his lips and blew shrilly 
at first no one answered his summons 
from the forecastle from thestokehold from aft came the ship s company making by instinct forthe high land of the bridge deck and from his eminence the littlecaptain scowled down upon them and swore 
it is not a wholesome sightto see grown men screaming through sheer terror and the sooner theyare dissociated either by words or blows from this frame of mind themore they will be able subsequently to respect themselves 
by dint of avinegar tongue and suggestive movements towards a pair of implementswhich bulged his jacket pockets kettle drove a gang of five to set themizzen trysail to keep the steamer head to sea 
she was rapidly losingher way and if she broached-to beam-on with that heavy sea running thelower decks would be filled with green water continuously and that with such a gaping rent where the hatch had been meant simply a rapidswamping 
then the captain looked round him seemingly for a messenger 
the mateof the watch hung on to the handle of the engine-room telegraph whichstill pointed to full speed ahead looking dazed and helpless 
thequartermaster s hands were mechanically sawing at the spokes of thewheel but it was equally evident that he also did not know what he wasdoing 
just then onslow raced up the bridge ladder three steps at a time 
 ah cried kettle now you are a man who can keep his head in a bitof a fluster and by james you re the only one on board 
just tumbleforward will you and get down into that hold 
see what s wrong onslow nodded and turned to go without a word 
from two or three of themen a thin cheer rose as he passed them and before he had gained thebottom of the ladder on to the iron lower deck half a dozen were on thetop rungs after him 
sailors will seldom refuse to follow when a superiorshows the way and besides these fellows were getting over their firstpanic and were beginning to be ashamed of themselves for giving way toit 
the mizzen trysail was not then set and because the steamer s way hadleft her she was falling off into the trough and rolling bulwarks underto every sea 
she was shipping water fast 
the creaming solid massessluicing across the deck-plates smote the men breech high with the weightof rams and he who when the waters were upon him left his hold wouldhave been swept like a cork to leeward 
but by the hatch-coamings thewinches and odd wet streamers of rope they clawed their way forward and cowered round the great hole made by the explosion holding there bythe edge of the twisted riven plates 
the seas creamed over their heads falling in noisy cascades into the blackness below and from out of thatdarkness above all the bellowing of wind and the clanging of iron andthe other din came a sodden whistling of water which seemed to confirmthe worst fears 
 pooh said some one trying to be cheery that s only the small supshe s shipped since the hatches were blown off 
the bilge pumps ll soonkick that drop overboard  guess you lie said another with a weary shake of the head 
then the ink of the heavens overhead was splashed with a vivid forkof lightning and the men saw onslow with his face as white as histeeth lowering himself over the brink and gripping with his knees atwisted iron pillar below 
the light above slapped out and within thedim jagged outline of where the hatch had been all was blackness 
andoverhead the thunder rumbled like the passing of a titan s gun-train 
the men shivered 
one of them an old white-haired able-seaman wasphysically sick 
and meanwhile the port edes rolled through forty-twodegrees and the gulf water flowed in green and black over each bulwarkalternately 
the men hung over the dark abyss of the hatch listening intently andabove the noises of the gale they could hear the sullen wash of water inthe hold growing heavier and more sullen with every roll 
another flashof lightning blazed out overhead painting white the shaft of the hatch and showing at its foot a muddy sea full of floating straws and barrelstaves and litter 
onslow was out of sight 
and the lower hold wasafloat almost to its deck-beams 
but presently the explorer returned swimming rather than walking asanother flash showed them and he leaped to the battens which made thestairway to overhead with the haste of a man who knows that the waste ofmoments may well cost human lives 
the men clustered about him round-eyedas he gained the deck for a word of what he had seen but he brushedthrough them roughly and made for aft 
it seemed to them that no spokensentence could have given a worse report of what had befallen thanthis mute action 
the fellows knew that officers always made the bestof everything if there is a best to be made and so the silence wasterribly suggestive 
at the same moment as if to confirm their worst fears the steamer tooka heavy sea clean over her forecastle head and above the din of thewater as it came cascading down into the lower deck there arose wildcries of she s sinking her bottom s blown out she s settling bythe head yelling these tidings the men scampered back to the bridge-deck where saving for the few driven off to set the mizzen trysail all the rest ofthe steamer s complement were collected 
 she s settling by the head 
it s making a clean breach over her thisminute 
she ll be down with us if we don t look quick then another voice cried let the foul old tramp go to hell by herself 
she shan t drown me for one while she s got a boat that ll swim 
comealong boys whereupon a mixed half-dozen of deck-hands and firemen madea rush for the foot of the upper bridge ladder 
at the head of that ladder stood captain kettle grinning like a torturedfiend 
the crew were acting precisely as it had been planned that theyshould act 
they were doing what a laboriously-formed plot had compelledthem to do 
but at that moment the little captain s weakness for battlenearly got the better of him and was within an ace of making himattempt to upset the entire apple-cart 
the idea of his men the despisedall-nation rabble whom he had brow-beaten into subjection all across thebroad atlantic taking the initiative into their own hands now was toomuch for him to swallow in a single dose 
sooner than submit he wouldhave ruined everything ten times over 
consequently he drew on the firstman who advanced up the ladder and his eyes lit up with the steady passionless glare of slaughter 
the fellow was brave enough desperate too as a man could be but uponcertain death he hesitated to advance 
indeed when kettle coming downthe ladder himself thrust him furiously back with a black pistol muzzle he retreated to the bridge-deck as did those who were with him 
but the other men of that worthy crew had no mind to be tyrannized overany longer when the steamer was momentarily settling down under theirfeet and drowning was an immediate question 
by the funnel stays and byone another s backs they swarmed on to the top of the fiddley and thencegaining the boat platforms set about cutting adrift the grimy awningswith their knives and clearing away the tackles and falls 
they shippedrudders and fitted the plugs and one or two with more forethought thantheir frightened fellows shouldered the boats water-breakers and tookthem aft to where the condenser-tap gave upon the lower deck 
kettle did not interfere 
he had held the bridge-deck ladders againstall comers and in some cranky way felt that his honor was unsmirched 
but he gave no help no hint no further order and surveyed the scenewith folded arms and a sour thin smile 
patrick onslow being moved by adifferent set of feelings acted more humanely 
 take time men he sung out coolly if you will be cowards and leavethe ship 
i don t think she ll sink at any rate not yet the men had knocked away the chocks hoisted the boats and swung thedavits outboard 
 keep your heads you trembling idiots 
pass your painters forwardbefore you begin to lower and don t lower till you ve victualled theboats 
you ve at least a hundred-and-fifty mile run before you can makecharlotte harbor which is your best port with this wind blowing and aslike as not you ll miss your road when you get inshore among the keys andreefs and be a week getting there a few of the men seeing the force of this ran below and raided thegalley and the steward s store-room of what they could lay hands upon 
but they only brought up one load of tins 
they were frightened lestthe others should in their terror go off without them 
so they bundledtheir gleanings pell-mell on to the floor gratings and with a dozenmen in each the boats began to lower away 
when they touched water the falls were let go to overhaul as they chose and then unhooked 
theboats rode by their painters swooping on one sea up to the level of thebridge-deck diving twenty feet down in the next trough and lying invery great danger of being stove to pieces 
a man in each was standing by the painter others were getting out oars 
 where s the donkeyman cried some one 
 and mr onslow  and the skipper  oh in the boat  then cast off 
we ve got all and we must be clear of the ship beforeshe founders or she ll take us down too in her wash the painters were slipped and from either beam the steamer s lifeboatsdiverged under the backing impulse of their oars 
out of sight of oneanother they dropped astern and each picking a favorable chance theyslewed round in a pother of spray 
then they stepped their masts and then one under a jib and the otherunder close-reefed lug they drove away before the wind leaving thesetting of a course for after consideration 
steamer sailors are not used to small-boat sailing in a heavy sea and ittakes them some time to wear down the novelty of it 
by a providence there was the second mate in one an old north sea smacksman to take thetiller and an able seaman from the same school in the other boat whowas also competent to manage her 
the boats were built for the weather but they required handling and excepting these two men there wereno others up to the task 
the rest trimmed ship some of them baling some too frightened to do anything but cling on to a thwart these lastfrom the fireholds mostly and with their complements in this danger anddisorder the port edes two lifeboats drove away into the night andthe north-north-east 
three men on the steamer from inside the chart-house watched the boatsgo away and one of them the donkeyman was wondering what kind of foolto call himself for being left 
chapter xiii 
three for twenty-seven 
 now my lads said kettle you ve got to hump yourselves or we llhave the steamer swamping beneath us 
it ll be touch and go anyway 
mr onslow you will have the deck all to yourself after you ve done yourjob on the forehold of course and you d better jump lively after thatat once 
every gill of water tells now and it strikes me if we get verymuch more of the mexican gulf on board the decks will blow up and she llgo down like kentledge ballast onslow darted away through the doorway 
 and now mister sullivan understand that although i still continueto rate as skipper of this craft for the present i m going to work asfireman and coal-trimmer 
you will be chief engineer and i m the sumtotal of your crew and between us we ve got to do the work of sevenhorses and one mule 
are the bilge-pumps clear  yes sor  and has she still a good head of steam  she has 
none s been blown off  then pick up your feet and let s go to your hardware shop and start inwork  wait a bit sor said the donkeyman 
 there s things here i don tunderstand 
aren t the lives of us in beastly danger 
didn t them boatsgo off because the steamer s sinking  do you retorted kettle consider me one of those fancy sorts ofmaniac who have no wish to survive the loss of a ship 
i tell you ishould have been drowned eight times already if that had been my lay 
no mr chief fair fight s right enough and i d stand up to nick in that and value my life at less than a rice-mat but at other times you bet i m no fool to chuck it away  but said the donkeyman what gets me s this 
if the bloomingsteamer s bottom s shot out what s the fun in messing with it 
themexican gulf will circulate through that hole longer than our bilge-pumpswill run  you tire me said the little man 
 who said she d her bottom blown out 
i tell you this steamer was sunk a few plates above her usual trim forreasons and now we are going to pull her up again 
see here do you takethe synch from me mr chief and ask no more questions and you ll gettold no lies 
it ll pay you 
if you do as you re bid aboard of me you llhave sovereigns enough given you to work through the biggest spree thatwas ever spread out in a seaport town the big donkeyman appreciatively drew the back of a hand across hismuzzle 
 ah captain dear he said coaxingly i d just like to hear ye mentiona figure  call it two ten-pound notes  then be christopher i m yer man for any piece of devilment in thecalendar 
come along captain dear 
 tis a melojious little man y are for all they say against yez meanwhile the steamer was becoming more and more waterlogged with everyplunge and roll and patrick onslow feared that his dangerous stratagemfor driving away the crew had been carried too far 
it seemed to himimpossible that they could salvage her now 
true she was brought up tothe wind by the after-canvas and her rollings were not of such sickeningstrength but the stern loomed high in the wild night air and the bowslunged deep into every successive sea that rolled up from the stormysouth taking green water over the forecastle head in masses whichscoured anchors and windlass to the naked iron 
the wash found its way below through that jagged gap in the lower deckin crashing water-falls and every moment too the opened valve besideher keel was gushing in fresh gallons to the swamping holds 
any largersea which swept up now might well settle over her solidly and launchher with bursted decks on to the sponges and the coral growths a hundredfathoms below 
some men in the face of such conditions would have been mazed helpless physically incapable in the presence of that solitude ofmaking any necessary effort for it is one thing to do a desperate matterbefore the eyes of an applauding crowd and another when the devilbelow is your only appreciative onlooker 
it would have been beyond thecapabilities of captain kettle for instance 
onslow however was theone man in the million to whom the adventure was as meat and drink 
if hesucceeded then the profit was his if he failed death would be usefulto him and anyway there was the wild excitement of the moment which wasa meal to be enjoyed and one which nothing could snatch away 
it was in this mood of mind that the man on whose actions the veryouter-air existence of the port edes depended left his fellows in thechart-house and raced forward to where the jagged lip of the foreholdhatch yawned to the swilling seas 
without lantern without so much asa look before him he lowered himself on to the twisted battens below with the clean water raining on to him from above and muddy waveletssquirting up from beneath and then when the steamer gave a heavy send and the more solid wash from the hold smote him heavily upon the thighs he loosed his grip and dived like a stone through the brimming shaft-wayof the hatch 
seconds passed a minute two minutes and still he did not reappear 
three minutes 
then the rounded outlines of something black rolled to thesurface and surged about limply with the swill of the water 
for a while it stayed so then swung by a heavier pitch of the steamer it was washed to the back of a stanchion where it hung 
the sloppingwater beneath ebbed steadily 
the valve in the steamer s bottom had beenclosed 
her bilge pumps were running at speed 
during a whole hour patrick onslow lodged behind that iron pillar amere boneless mass of flesh and clothes and then the pains of life cameinto him again with shivers and shudderings 
the thin gray light of thedawn was filtering down through the jagged opening above when first thetrembling lids slid from his eyeballs but for still another thirtyminutes he was a thing of no wit breathing truly but caring naught forall the world contained 
then a sucking sobbing noise from the depths of the hold far beneathbroke upon his ear and the languid brain began to work 
with an efforthe sat up dizzily holding to the pillar trying to think where he was and how ran recent history and by degrees the details strolled backto him 
before however he had gathered all his senses or a workingquantum of strength he had a visitor in the shape of the donkeyman whoclattered up over the decks with plate-shod boots and crouched besidethe gap above on knees and hands 
 have you been getting hurt now inquired this new-comer 
 about nine-tenths drowned i fancy if that counts 
but i m pretty nearall right again now  ye don t look ut replied the donkeyman candidly 
 barrin the tan ye d be blue and lard color about the face this minute 
but i fearedthere was something wrong through not seeing ye on the bridge so inipped into the chart-room and pockutted a whisky-bottle that was lyingconvenient in case 
pull at the small end sor the bottle was handed down and onslow lifted it his teeth chatteringagainst the nozzle like castanets but the spirit drove up color intohis face and set the sluggish blood once more on its appointed journeythrough his limbs and trunk 
 what has happened since i left you he asked 
 well first sor the captain and meself had a little friendlydiscussion about what s been happening and came to a bit of a financialagreement 
but i will say that i figured me new terms very low when iunderstood it was a thrifle of a conspiracy that ye wanted me to standin at 
and then sor we went below to the engine-room and turned steaminto the bilge pumps to heave this nasty slop of water overboard after which as chief i set about making a thrifting repair to thelow-pressure engine 
ye see when that explosion took place a bit of acasting jumped into the crank-pit and got jammed there hard before theycould stop her 
i ve had a fair do at elbow work cutting it out cold but it s clear now and she runs as sweetly as she did the day she leftthe shops 
but oh mr onslow i wish you could see the old man 
thesight of that little chap shoveling coals and swearing and tumbling and burning himself is enough to make the ghosts of some dead firemen iknow about grin and dance sand-jigs in their graves the donkeyman was inclined to be garrulous and evidently lusted for aconsiderable chat but with returning strength onslow s anxiety grewon him again and he climbed out on deck keen to be once more in action 
his knees were tottery and the donkeyman gave him an arm aft 
but whenhe had climbed up the ladder and gained the bridge deck he stood for aminute staring and then threw up his hands and pitched forward on to theplanking as though a bullet had bitten the life in his brain 
the big donkeyman also was startled 
out of the morning mists of thesouth there had come up a small center-board schooner of some fifteentons an oysterman perhaps in the season and now a sponge-gatherer ora mere coaster 
she was coming down over the seas dry as a gull drivingalong under her boom foresail and jib 
the donkeyman s eye hung on her as she surged past the rust-streakedflank of the steamer some twenty fathoms away not because the sightof a little white-painted schooner was new to him not because he wasimpressed by the danger to the port edes enterprise in her being seenby any alien eye but on account of the tiny vessel being handled inwhat to her was distinctly ugly weather by so extraordinary a person asa young and pretty girl 
no one else was on deck and the girl sat on thecoaming of the cockpit tiller in one hand tiller rope in the other asunconcernedly as though she had been an ancient mariner bred and aged infore-and-afters 
she was a girl too with looks much to the irishman s liking withcopper-red hair whose ends blew out from beneath a green italian snightcap laughing impudent features with the color whipped up intowarm pinks by the wind a figure of pretty curves and the shapeliestlittle brown fists in the world splayed on the tiller and gripping therestraining tiller-rope 
she was fairly well up to the eyes in hersteering but she found time to throw an illade towards the steamer which mr sullivan answered with a yell intended to show his completeadmiration and a swirl of his greasy cap 
it was then that onslow fell and the donkeyman took his eyes from the schooner and picked him up andonce more applied the whisky-bottle 
 more drowned than i thought for he muttered 
 it ll be a pig s mess for us if he goes ill but patrick onslow had not fainted through the effect of his recentstruggle with death 
it was quite another matter which had dealt him thesufficing shock 
in the steerer of that little schooner he had seen the sister of thewoman to whom he had once been affianced who had discarded him foranother man who had driven him from a sedate english life to be awanderer and a vagabond upon the face of the earth 
his roamings hadbegun and continued only because the image of this one woman had refusedto leave his thoughts and the half-sarcastic nickname of the greattraveler had been gained without any seeking on his part 
five long desperate years had passed since the blow fell upon him andtime was doing its work 
he had begun to forget her to promise himselfthat this present enterprise accomplished he would eliminate thepast and lead a different and cleaner life and yet here on the mostunlikely corner of god s earth her sister passed like a stage figurebefore his eyes the sister from whom she was never parted 
the shock came upon him as a thunderbolt from a blue sky 
he had fanciedher to be in england europe australia anywhere but here 
in his weakstate the surprise was too great 
again the gush of the waters thunderedin his ear again the light faded from his eyes and this time he divedinto blank unconsciousness 
chapter xiv 
a pirates harbor 
windless swell and a burning sky 
ahead broken palings of mop-headedtree-trunks growing straight across the sea on one beam scatteredpatches of white where the surf crumbled over hidden coral reef onthe other the bright blue water of the mexican gulf with its yellowfloating tangles of weed 
a steamer lunging through the rollers at asmall six knots 
on her decks was visible one man and one alone and he was on the upperbridge with his fists on the spokes of the steam steering-wheel 
hewas swaying with weariness his eyes were dull and leaden his cheekswere of an unwholesome yellow because the tan would not let them turnpale white 
yet his task was one which put to the strain every piece ofhis alertness 
he was taking a steamer drawing nineteen feet through achannel of whose very existence no man on earth besides himself had everguessed and already he was deep in sea-territory which the charts of still mark as unsurveyed he had vaguely found the channel somemonths before in an open boat and written cross compass-bearings on theback of a crumpled envelope 
these he carried in his head now and usedas the sea-marks closed but they were a frail reed for much dependence 
for such work a leadsman is an absolute necessity and on board the portedes a leadsman was an absolute impossibility 
the remaining two of hermanning were working as ten men to keep up any head of steam for herengines 
and so patrick onslow took his soundings with eye and nostrils as do some of the more ancient of the coaster folk and instinct did not upon the whole serve him badly 
twice he scoured the steamer s bottomplates over branching coral plants which broke away with clatteringjars and let her through to deeper water ahead and once he ran upon atail of white sand which pinned her just forward of midships 
but herang off the engines waited till the scream of the escape-pipe showed afull head of steam and then on a flowing tide put her full speed astern and slid clear 
the skipper in the stokehold below waxed blasphemous at the man who had got the shore on board but he did not cease from shoveling coals neither did the big donkeyman save at those moments when the clang ofthe telegraph-bell called him to stand by the throttle or reversing gearin the engine-room 
so the port edes drew up this narrow unknown sea-river through theshallows which fill that bight of the s w floridan coast and the tiredman who was governing her steered every hour with stronger confidence andduller consciousness 
now he held on to what was apparently an unbrokenline of surf where if the steamer struck she would be a stove-inwreck within the hour but as she closed with it a passage opened outwhich took her through in clear water although the yeasty surges of thebackwash would leap like live things far up her sides and scream andbellow through the scuppers 
now he dodged with helm hard a-starboardone minute hard to port the next amongst an archipelago of unnamedkeys where the first mangrove trees were getting to work at buildingthese outlying scraps of animal stone into part of the north americancontinent 
beyond was a broad smooth lagoon shimmering in the sunlight dancingwith little silver waves and beyond again was a wall of woodworkgrowing in one solid mass of trunks from behind the tangle of slimymangroves which sprawled along the water s edge 
bare land was to be seennowhere all was blotted out by the rank luxuriance of the subtropicalflora 
the steamer held on her course athwart this placid sea-lake aimingstraight as a rifle-shot for what appeared to be the densest part of theforest 
but as she neared it an overlapping cape gradually distinguisheditself from the rest of the greenery and directly afterwards banks ofmilky sand opened out with a gut of river between them 
onslow steered on sitting upon the grating now and holding the wheelone-handed by the lower spokes and in the fat hot stew of the stokeholdbelow kettle and the donkeyman shoveled coal to the light of reekingslush-lamps and the tune of furnace-roar 
the steamer in grip of the river-stream swung round the bights andtwistings finding deep water everywhere though often she could notmake the turn quickly enough and bruised with her forefoot the slimymangrove-stems which marked the bank 
but the current was strong andeach time swept her clear and those below were scarcely conscious of thegraze 
knot by knot the brine of the mexican gulf was being left behind andthe noises of the woods and odors of the trees and the swamps wereclosing in upon them 
the swell fanning out from the steamer s wakewetted the alligators in their basking-places behind the saw-grass and the reek from her smoke-stacks scared the stilt-legged waterfowlafish in the shallows 
she coasted round a bayou of black water walledin by stern ranks of cypress-trees she cut across another withgraceful-leaved palmetto-scrub on either hand and ragged cabbage-palmssprouting out from above 
and then she swung again where the riverforked and steamed down a straight unswerving water-line which led tothe very heart of the everglades 
but the pace was slowing now slowing indeed till the steamer wouldhardly steer against the current which ever and anon gripped her by thehead or the tail and carried her with sullen sheerings on to mangrovecluster or tree-clad bluff 
and the reason was that the head of steam wasfailing 
captain owen kettle as more christian men have done before ignored his own previous preachings when the application came in andproved only human soon after he had taken up the r le of fireman 
driven half lunatic by the heat and the work he kept dipping his lipsin the water-bucket and drinking heavy draughts 
as a consequence thatunpoetical complaint cramp in the stomach overtook him at last andtied him into those ungainly knots of torture which he had so frequentlyobserved upon scientifically in others 
but as there was no one athand to administer the heroic remedy of chlorodyne cum rhubarb cum laudanum cum pill and give him something else to think about in theoriginal kind of knots he remained 
the donkeyman with a hearty belfast curse tried to do double work but as he had been laboring quite to the top of his strength for manyhours previously the effort did not meet with unqualified success 
asanyone with less dogged wooden pluck might have known it is impossiblefor one man to fire a twelve-furnace steamer wheel himself coal from thebunkers and act as engineer and greaser when required however great bethe initial supply of brute force with which god has endowed him 
everytime he wiped the wet from his eyes and looked at the steam-gauge it hadclimbed down since the time before and however furiously he might heavenew fuel on to the caking clinkers that jumping index would continue itsdownward crawl 
the oiled rumbling of the engines slowed and grew more sluggish andthen the ponderous cranks took to stopping on a turn as though togain strength for the next round 
but this did not go on for long 
thedonkeyman felt a gentle heave of the foot-plates beneath him and thena heel which was not recovered 
 and begor said he the bucking oldtramp s tuk the ground at last thanks be he pitched his shovel through a dull glowing furnace-door and turned towhere the little captain was lying on the polished foot-plates holding ayellow flaring slush-lamp before him to see through the stifling dustygloom 
 gum he exclaimed the old man looks pretty sick 
i ll crane him up inthe ash-lift this he did and took his commanding officer into the main cabin wherethe air was bright and baking and the mosquitoes were biting like dogs 
then throwing back the lid of the medicine-chest which stood besidethe door into the companion way he gazed appreciatively at the rows ofbottles unstoppered one or two and sniffed at their contents and thenslammed down the lid again as a thought struck him 
 no he said i m blistered if i do 
red kettle wouldn t give me physiclast time i thought i d like a dose an now i ll see how he fanciesgetting round on nothing 
fair play s a jool 
i ll just report to thepilot an then turn in the pilot however when the donkeyman had wearily hauled himself on tothe upper bridge and stood by his side proved to be so dead asleep thatno amount of shouting or shaking would wake him 
even the flies did notmake him wince 
 sor wake or ye ll be sunstrook if ye re not that already 
rouse sor i can t lug ye below an i can t rig an awnin 
i m too tired to spakeagain but if yez stay here ye ll fry like a rasher an be ate by flies 
there s a whopping skeeter in each of yer eyeholes this minut an a kindof a locust browsing on the end of yer snout 
listen 
i m knockin wid aboot-toe on yer ribs 
well man now if ye won t listen to reason it sjust leavin yez i am to stew in yer own juice the donkeyman clumped heavily back down the ladder and went with wearysteps aft along the bridge-deck towards his own place 
but at the breakof the deck he paused spread his grimy shiny elbows on the rail andindulged in a thin small whistle 
 now here he soliloquized we have come as the skipper remarked up an unbeknown drain to which man s improvements have not beenintrojuced and there s callers turning up already 
that was the noseof a gaff-taups l squintin between those treetops down-stream a minuteago or i m a dago 
d ye know mr sullivan chief of the port edes i m beginning to think ye d have got better value if ye d gone cruisin off by an large with the other boys in the lifeboats 
thrue there s thetwenty one-pound notes to dhraw and a daisy of a spree to have if ye canget anywhere to have ut but ye ve worked that wage out already me son an it rather seems as though there s more laboriousness to follow he yawned cavernously 
 tisn t often i d say no to a bit of ascrimmage but theatricals are not to my taste just now at all 
too muchovertime ruins the sense of humor he yawned again and blinked his eyes drearily 
 you must turn in now mr sullivan dear or ye ll fall down here and be ate alive by theskeeters an other wild beasts of the forrust and if the explorers whoare underneath that white gaff-taups l want to come aboard here and makethrouble so far as you re concerned they ll be let and with that the donkeyman staggered away to his room beneath the poop sat over the edge of his bunk and was snoring melodiously before hishead and his heels were on the blanket 
meanwhile a mile lower down a small center-board sloop was turning towindward up the river but making little headway against the current 
anegro stood in her fore-scuttle with his elbows on the deck 
two otherssprawled on either side of him 
a big white man lay spread-eagled on thetop of the coach-roof of the cabin and another stood in the cockpitsteering 
of all the quintette the man at the tiller was the only one who showedsigns of energy and his energy had sulphurous anger mixed with it 
hewas a bowed shambling creature with one eye red and the other missing with long hairy ape-like arms and with a dumb impediment of speech which threw him into paroxysms of temper every second time he opened hislips 
once or twice when his malady struck him voiceless in the middleof a sentence the other white man laughed and then when his tongueserved him again the helmsman would break off from the text and rap outa stream of poisonous cursings 
at last he climaxed these by the only vituperation which no american canlisten to unmoved and the man on the coach-roof dropped his indolencelike a flash and was on him before he could resist 
the aggressorwas lusty and he shook the steersman as a big dog shakes a rat withponderous wrenches and because the sloop carried a strong weather helm when the tiller was let go she ran up into the wind with her canvasslatting wildly 
 you snake-mouthed little skunk 
you d say that to me would you 
ithought i learned you once before how far you might go 
you ve had oneeye gouged for this game less n a month back and if you fling yourtwisted stuttering tongue at me any more by gum i ll pocket the other the blacks on the fore-deck chuckled and spluttered but the big man hovean iron bucket at them with curt command to quit that ye-hawin whichthey did with a yell and a sudden veiling of ivory 
then by an indolentsprawling of the arms and legs he gained his basking-place again on thetop of the cabin-roof and once more the steersman got the sloop undercommand 
the next three boards were made in silence save for the creaking of gearwhen she went about and then the one-eyed man broke out again  you re sure it wasn t a government bo-o-o-at hank  government be sugared 
she wasn t the right build to start with 
besides if government knew this channel at all you bet it d be saidso in all the papers 
and she did know it or she wouldn t have gonebuzzing past at six knots without a leadsman 
seems to me someone ssplit and she s some darned britisher come to cut out our game forthemselves  you tire me 
plume-hunting s illegal by these bub-bub-blessed bird laws and so s selling whisky to injuns 
as it is we ve trouble enough tosneak in and out of the glades in this sus-sus-sus-s-s-lip of a sloop so how in snakes d you expect they d do it in a thousand-ton here the man s infirmity blocked his speech for a minute 
he snarled out  oh i ve no use for a blank puttyhead like you hank laughed and put tobacco into his mouth 
 go it he said go it right close to the end if you like but bring up short of that or i llgouge you sure s death the steersman grinned a spasm of fury 
he longed much to use again theunpardonable phrase but he forbore 
he felt that his friend would be asgood as his word 
so he ceased from speech altogether and a negro on thefore-deck enlivened the silence with the jordan hymn giving full valueto every possible shake and turn 
a porpoise surged past them making for the open after a day sfresh-water fishing and once or twice an alligator s eyebrows and snoutshowed like knots of black wood floating up against the current forthis was territory where the skin-hunter s rifle had not scared themaltogether into night-work 
the sloop s pace up-stream was small and itwas not till just before nightfall that she rounded a cape where highblack pines stood up like soldiers on parade around the water s edge andthere saw the intruder 
the steamer was grounded on a sandbank athwartthe stream and lay with a two-foot list away from the current 
notuntil they were close aboard of her could those on the sloop see the goldlettering on her counter 
 b-b-both lifeboats gone 
say that s rum  port edes of london hank read 
 port edes 
i seem to knowthat name he swung his long legs down over the cabin doorway andsat staring at his companion with open-mouthed wonder 
 hallo nutt he said what s wrong now 
i haven t seen you wear that kind o facebefore 
you couldn t look pleaseder if i d said your rich uncle had gonedead 
there s no pards of ours aboard of her is there the one-eyed man s face was lit up with an unholy joy 
 don t you know he stuttered out 
 the biz was in all the papers 
that steamboat wasbringing out half a million of sovereigns 
her port was new orleans andshe s got here 
by gum i s pose they think they re going to s-s-steal itall by themselves  steal 
what do you mean  oh you idiot 
what would they come here at all for if it was all right  who s they inquired hank 
 i gug-gug-guess we shall know that soon returned the one-eyed mangrimly 
 hi you niggers there forward 
i s pose you got razors hidsomewhere in yer pants  say drawled his friend you d mebbe better go slow over this deal mr billy nutt 
the steamer does look asleep but if you start makingyour self ugly too soon somebody may wake up and pull off guns at us  i ve been mum-mum-missed before  so ve i sonny 
that s why there s all the more chance of being hit now 
you go slow billy nutt just go slow 
if they see that ugly face ofyours and hear you talk somebody ll shoot sure s death  shoot or no shoot retorted the man at the tiller i m going to havesome of their plunder before a dozen hours are over or else be a deader 
i never had a chance like this in all my life before and i ll nevergeg-geg-get another  you bet not agreed his friend 
 nor ll i that s why i ll stand inwith you over this deal down to the last chip 
i guess it s the one softthing i ve been looking for all through a lifetime 
i thought once i wasgoing to make my pile out of breaking monte carlo 
then it was a cornerin pork 
then we tried to stick up a mail train and raid the dollars outof the express car 
but all these operations kinder weakened when it cameto the point 
i s pose we didn t put enough jump into them 
but we ll notget euchred for want of that here 
no siree 
you and me billy nutt lleither come out topside over this deal or else die in our boots 
youhear me 
i reckon he added in a lower voice we can count well on theniggers too 
they re not exactly a camp-meeting crowd 
they re toughsthat a racket like this ll suit as nat ral as chicken-stealing he bent forward over the coach-roof and communicated the scheme to thenegroes in a few words 
the mobile african faces changed like children s 
they became savage and animal-like 
the fellow who but a short whilebefore had carried such a look of touching devotion as he trolled outthe jordan hymn ceased almost to be human 
in a flash he had turned toa lustful savage beast with glinting yellow eyeballs gripping a razorwith one black paw and ready to grapple anything with the other 
theveneer of american civilization had slid from him like some tatteredwrap 
he was a fitting specimen of the most dangerous made race ofwhich this world can at present boast 
even hank was half alarmed at the furies he had unchained 
 see here fellows he said as an after-thought 
 just take care which way you runwhen we get aboard that steamer and don t get foul of billy nutt and me 
if you try any of your blame nigger carving games on us i guess you llturn into cold meat quicker n you can wink 
nutt and me are the handiestmen with guns in this section of florida  all right boss no shirt said he of the razor 
 well i was just telling you returned the big man 
 and now quiet all hands 
if we can slip aboard without anybody hailing us it ll behealthier for us whatever it may be for other people once more the noises of the forest and the occasional creaking of thesloop s gear made up the only sounds and from beyond the westerntreetops the brazen sun took a final glare at them before it dived torest for the night

results in london 
 how awfully ghastly said amy rivers 
 yes said fairfax those anarchist people ought to be shot down likedangerous wild beasts whenever they open their mouths 
think of it 
notonly a fine ship but half a million in specie blotted out of existenceby this murderous bomb 
it will come fearfully heavy on some of theunderwriters 
there will be a black pay-day at lloyd s when they settleup over this 
you never saw such excitement as there is in the city 
papers were selling at half a crown apiece  and is it certain that poor mr onslow is drowned  i m afraid practically so 
the two lifeboats were picked up nextmorning and their crews taken into mobile 
when they came to count headsit was found that the captain and onslow and one of the engine-roomhands were missing 
in the hurry of the escape they seem to have gotinto neither lifeboat 
the telegram says that no other boat would havelived a minute in the sea that was running at the time even if one hadbeen lowered 
and the mate who writes does not think that this waseven attempted because the port edes sank before the two lifeboatshad driven out of sight 
we had a private cablegram at the office beforei left and that told how other steamers crossing that part of the gulfhad been on the look-out but up to then not even so much as a scrap ofwreckage had been sighted 
so i fear it is past a doubt that she sanklike a stone in deep water and took those poor fellows down with her  it is horribly sad especially when one remembers what i heard thismorning hamilton 
the girl mr onslow went wild about six years ago isout in florida this minute and free 
duvernay the man she married died six months ago of malarial fever 
you know mr onslow was engagedto her just after he left cambridge and went as an attach and wasdesperately fond of her as i imagined he could be and when her peopleforced her into marrying the other fellow he threw up his post andwandered into all the most out-of-the-way corners of the earth to tryand forget things 
what makes me so interested is this i ve just foundout that she was a miss mabel kildare before she was married and when iwas a child i used to know her sister elsie very well indeed 
in fact i believe we were some sort of cousins and for half a year we had thesame governess together and were as intimate as two children could be 
then her sister married mr duvernay who had a colonial appointment andelsie went with them abroad and we dropped completely out of touch withone another 
strange isn t it that i should hear of her again the sameday that brings news of poor mr onslow s death  it s a small world this said fairfax sententiously and coincidencesare the commonest things in it 
i suppose in a novel the pair of themought to have come together and forgiven the past and married andsettled down in a villa residence with ivy and clematis attachment andlived happily ever afterwards 
unfortunately real life is balder and farless romantic  you seem out of spirits said his fianc e linking her fingers overhis arm 
 i suppose i am 
to begin with this port edes business isn tcalculated to enliven one and then on the top of that i ve hadanother taste of your blessed guardian s business methods which hasnearly sickened me out of the office altogether 
you know about this brothers steamship company which he is trying to float 
well wehad a preliminary meeting to-day quite a thousand people and all comparatively speaking poor 
they were for the most part the gang hepreaches to on sunday with a sprinkling of skippers out of work andother sea-faring folk who had saved a trifle of money 
 shelf commenced the business with prayer which is right enough at itsproper time but struck me as being particularly out of place there 
the audience however groaned approval and their confidence in theman seemed to be strengthened 
he followed this up with a clever speechabout the profits to be made out of the modern sea-carrying trade andenlarged upon the notorious fact that the losses of the business largelyarose from the lack of interest on the part of the ship-masters and otherofficers 
this last he said would be entirely removed in the brotherss s co because by the articles of association no man would hold aresponsible position on any one of their vessels who was not an actualshareholder of the company 
and then he pointed out that there was aneight per cent 
dividend guaranteed on preference stock and a certainfifteen or eighteen per cent 
on the ordinary and wound up with anotherdose of cant 
the company he said would not be alone content withearning income for its bond-holders it would have as its equal objectthe spreading of the gospel and the civilization of england to theuttermost parts of the globe 
 then the meeting cheered and amenned and wrote out an application for shares then and there in the room on forms which were handedround and down your blessed guardian went on his knees again and prayedfor grace to bless his efforts and when the poor fools dispersed mr theodore shelf and i drove back to the offices 
 look here i said to him you ve put me down on the directorate ofthis thing with a salary of a year 
i want to resign  what on earth for  oh 
shall we say i haven t sufficient loose money to take up enoughshares  but he said quickly you needn t take up many 
you can draw yourfirst quarter s salary and pay that back to the company s bankers on yourfirst call 
that will qualify you  no i said i m not going to do that 
i m going to be mixed up withthis new company in no degree whatever 
flatly i don t believe in thething one bit 
it s a notorious fact that freights are so low just nowthat thousands of tons of shipping is laid up because it can t be run ata profit and if you put more in commission freights will tumble downstill lower  you speak from your ignorance he said 
 i should remind you that iam by far an older man and have a much deeper experience 
the businessof marmaduke rivers and shelf is a lasting monument of what my humbletalents can accomplish and you will some day see for yourself thenewer company on an equal footing 
did you not notice what enthusiasticconfidence in its prosperity those humble friends of mine showed thisafternoon  a fat lot they know about the shipping business said i 
 in themood you worked them up to they d have believed in an advertisingstock-broker s circular if only there were a text at the head of thepage  shelf pulled the check-string and his brougham stopped against thekerb 
 mr 
fairfax said he your attitude pains me 
let us part herefor the time and let us both pray that when next we meet you may be ina more christian mind whereupon out i stepped and came along hereto park lane 
amy dear i don t like the look of things at all 
theother business the oceanic steam transport company as it is calledofficially is by no means in a healthy condition and remembering that it seems to me that starting this new company is something very nearlyapproaching a swindle 
i believe that theodore shelf is finding out thathe is in low water and is getting desperate  i don t know about the last replied the girl thoughtfully but asfor being in low water there i think you are wrong 
every week herethey seem to spend more money than they did the week before 
mrs 
shelfwas at a picture sale yesterday and bought two old masters at fourthousand guineas apiece and it isn t likely she d throw away that sumon what is absolutely and entirely a luxury unless money were prettyplentiful with her  it can t go on at this pace said fairfax 
 i know what the limits ofthe business are and i m certain it can t stand the drain on them whichall this gorgeousness must entail 
last year the profits were almostnil and yet did mrs 
shelf retrench at all 
not a bit 
she goes in formore and more display every week she lives 
this pace must bring about awreck and if the oceanic steam transport company goes down it is anabsolute certainty that this new brothers company will be swamped withit  and then  more than a thousand poor people for the most of them old will findthat the savings of a lifetime have vanished into nothingness beforetheir eyes 
it is an awful thing even to think such a suspicion againsta man but the idea is growing upon me and theodore shelf saw what ithought when he showed me out of his brougham this afternoon  then what asked the girl in a horrified whisper will you do  nothing 
what can i do 
to breathe a word of it aloud would be a libel and if i did not get sent to jail they would pack me off to hanwell asa malicious madman 
shelf s name is as good as a banknote in the citythis day and for everybody s sake i trust that i have wronged himfoully and that it may always continue so 
but amy dear i have a heavyforeboding on me that in less than half a year s time there will be a mobof wretched people shooting themselves or going to the workhouse becausehe has ruined them and they haven t the pluck or the thews left tocommence life afresh chapter xvi 
for the birthday list 
mr theodore shelf was a gourmand of the first water 
he preached mostviolently against all people who drank to excess and seemed scarcely todiscriminate between these and other people who were decorously moderate 
he included them all in one sweeping anathema and rammed home hischarges with countless texts always once a sunday and usually on severalweekdays as well 
he was a powerful exhorter in his own particular narrowgroove was mr theodore shelf and a vast number of people believed inhim and put out their savings to usury under his directions 
but he was as i say a gourmand of note 
he paid his chef ayear and would have thought himself permanently injured in constitutionif his truffles by accident happened to be english and not from perigordforest 
he over-ate himself habitually and made no particular disguiseabout it 
there is no influential society to make a national sin ofbestial over-feeding or otherwise mr theodore shelf would doubtlesshave posed as an ascetic in public and kept biscuits and a jar of foiegras beside the brandy-bottle in the safe 
there wasn t a man in englandwho knew better how to get the votes of his clique and their influence and the handling of their money 
there was not a man in europe lessinclined to mortify the flesh or undergo exertion without adequate return 
he was not a vastly clever man if one came to add him up 
he had climbedfrom a humble clerkship to a very giddy eminence by the nice exerciseof three strong faculties 
he had great discrimination he was a quickthinker and he was brilliantly unscrupulous 
when he saw a move that would eventually pay him he had the wit tosingle it out in an instant from a thousand others and decide on theroad which led to his own personal profit 
then he disregarded the sneersof the well-dressed crowd rather courted them in fact when they enabledhim to pose as a martyr and went in for the project heart tongue andsoul 
he could put such beautiful unction into the performance thateven the most bigoted of the enemy never thought of questioning his ownpersonal sanctity and meanwhile the great earnest mob of his followerswere chorusing the man s praises with fervor and fanatical zeal 
it has been stated that mr theodore shelf was a man entirely wantingthe saving salt of humor 
but this i think is wrong 
when he was alone hewould take george on his knee and whisper in that small animal s ear and call up a sardonic expression amongst the smug sanctimonious linesof his face that was not carried there in outer life 
at times too hewould even laugh a new gleeful laugh far different from the saintlyreproving smile which was the only sign of mirth that ever illuminatedhis features before a more talkative confidant 
but then george wastaciturn he could express whole pages by one quick pucker of the noseand half a tail-wag and he was never known to gossip 
perhaps it wasbecause he made such a prodigiously safe confidant that mr theodoreshelf was so fond of george 
in social standing george was not a gentleman 
nature had intended himfor the professional extinction of rats and given him a preternaturalgutter cleverness 
fate had him surrounded with affluence and regularmeals 
the pursuit of rats was forbidden him battles with canineacquaintances were discouraged and his one dissipation was sneakingaway from his residence and making love to the barmaid in an adjacentpublic-house in return for biscuits and sugar 
as a general result hewaxed portly and could look upon most kinds of rascality with a lenienteye and perfectly understood why mr shelf s private brandy-bottlelodged in retirement from the public view 
now mr theodore shelf s dinner parties as sent up by the inventiveand excellent chef aforesaid were celebrated all over london which despite all the charges laid against it by continental neighbors isa city which does contain some people who appreciate the exquisite infood 
shelf who despised no means of furthering his material interests naturally traded upon his celebrity in this matter and distributed hisdinner invitations with a keen eye to some adequate return 
but he wasusually content to leave the actual making-up of all parties to his wife 
he could quite trust her in this matter 
she was not likely to expend asingle cover uselessly 
she had a wonderfully nice appreciation of themain chance 
a clever woman mrs 
shelf 
on the night of the day that the brothers steamship company was floatedshe had arranged a dinner-table at her house which is destined to livedown through time 
there was a great cabinet minister present who asthe chief guest took her down to dinner and there was also in the roomthe ambassador from one of the greater continental courts with whom theminister had after dinner ten minutes of quiet informal talk in thecorner of the drawing-room 
that talk laid the groundwork of a certaininternational agreement afterwards elaborated which has never yet beenmade public 
but some day it will be sprung upon europe with a crash anda whirlwind of wonder and then the papers will refer to mrs theodoreshelf s dinner-table as a manufactory of history 
be it confessed however that mrs 
shelf had not asked the two to meetthrough any high-minded wish to better the empire 
she was singularlyuntrammeled by patriotism of that variety 
the principal power whosebetterment she had at heart was the house of shelf as consisting ofhusband and self and when she sat down at the head of her table andwatched the great minister next her unfold his napkin she made up hermind to do great deeds that night 
she did not rush headlong to the attack 
she had prepared her groundskilfully and knew how to play her game with due deliberation 
on theother side of the minister was amy rivers a bright sprightly personage of whom he was extremely fond and to whose conversation his hostesscleverly dismissed him before they were halfway through the horsd uvres 
oysters la sib rienne followed and as the great man was selectingthe plump natives he fancied from their tray of ice he turned round tomrs 
shelf as though to engage in talk with her 
but her time was notyet ripe 
the minister was a professed gourmet and the wines thatnight were the best the world could produce 
theodore shelf made noobjection to these 
he professed to abstain from wines himself but heprovided them for others as he did billiards 
and mrs 
shelf trustedthat the glorious vintages would sweep the austerity from the minister ssoul 
the minister sipped his chablis and his eye kindled 
 i shouldn t like he said to amy rivers to be a poor man and notknow people and not go out anywhere 
the sweets of life are its pleasantsurprises 
that s the best wine of its name in england this minute  i am not replied miss rivers going to talk food with you 
if youwant that you must shout down the table at mr shelf  oh youth youth said the minister how much you miss 
at one time ithought dublin porter an excellent tipple to drink with my oysters andas for you my dear you don t trouble your head about it at all 
i usedto think i d like to marry you supposing heaven made me single again 
but now  now i suppose i shall have to put up with hamilton fairfax asarranged 
well there are worse fates  you seem to bear up under it wonderfully  don t i 
you can come to the wedding if you ll promise not to look toowoebegone  i sha n t come 
i shall send you an inexpensive present with black edgesto it  so long as it isn t entr e dishes 
we ve tons of them already 
ithought i d mention it because one knows how your tastes lie the great man squeezed lemon on to the last of his oysters and ate itwith a satisfied nod of the head 
 date fixed he asked 
 if it is break the sad news to me gently 
don tbe too cruel  the date s fixed within limits 
we ve bought a place to live in and ifit s ready we shall be married the day i come of age  bought a place have you 
come this looks like business 
where is it 
got a good cook 
any shooting 
going to ask me down 
because if you do i ll come and teach you how to make me comfortable  yes i believe you could do that last 
those papers which don t call youthe pope of politics every morning say you re the most incapable man inbritain in most matters but i never heard that the most vicious of themever accused you of living in discomfort 
you ve a wonderful knack oflooking after yourself  haven t i 
don t spoil your health with salted almonds nibble one ofthese riviera olives 
life is made for suiting your own tastes as muchas possible and where practical making your neighbors pay for them 
why isn t fairfax here to-night 
are we all too big for him  hamilton is away on business looking after the place we re goingto buy in kent 
i shall see him later 
but just now i m having aholiday said miss rivers 
 i wanted to flirt with you 
you re safe andamusing amusing that is when you keep off the menu 
where are yougoing to after here to-night  oh to a horrible political thing where we shall all be good and talkhumbug and be bored to death 
if i hadn t chanced to be in the cabinet i should probably have gone to see a prize-fight his eye traveled downthe table to where theodore shelf was looking saintly with his head onone side and washing his large white hands with invisible soap 
 i dchance it my dear and go if i thought i could manage to meet amy rivers had followed his glance 
she turned to him with a demure smile 
 well she said who  oh just one or two of my colleagues on the same side of the house 
hangit all amy the fellows can t always be what they set up for in front oftheir clients miss rivers laughed 
 you re a bold bad lot she said 
 i know i shall see you in thepolice-court one of these days for breaking lamp-posts or running awaywith a hansom cab 
there s a vein of wickedness in you that s completelythrown away in a cabinet minister his lordship grinned and turned to mrs 
shelf 
he admired mrs 
shelfbecause she was an extremely handsome woman 
he rather dreaded her justnow because he knew she wanted something out of him 
and he had to talkto her because it was policy to do so 
 the complete art of spreading butter is not one to be mastered byeverybody 
in the lower grades it is easy any one can tickle a fool 
butwhen the subject has wallowed in all the cleverest kinds of flattery formany years of his life then it is a different matter 
if you set aboutyour work in a clumsy way he begins at once to mildly hate you 
if youonly half do it the man is resentful because he has not received his due 
mrs 
shelf avoided the pitfalls 
the great minister stayed suspicious shecould not alter that but she put him in a most excellent humor withhimself and the dinner was surpassing good 
he took k mmel and cognacfor his liqueur and she watched an ecstasy flicker to his face as hedrained the little glass 
the hum of the talk rose high in the room andher voice met his ear alone 
he heard her asking that theodore shelfmight be elevated to the house of lords 
he put the glass to the table still holding the stem between hisfingers 
he looked at it thoughtfully shaking his head the while 
 my husband is a power you can t neglect she continued 
 he alwaysvotes straight for your party  yes he is one of us the minister admitted softly with a gentleemphasis on the numeral 
 so far 
but he has his principles to consider 
he might find itnecessary from the dictates of his conscience to separate himself fromyou on one or two matters in the next session 
i m afraid his followingwould go with him 
you know he has vast influence with a certain class the minister stretched out lazy fingers and took a saltspoon andmade two little neat heaps of salt on the table-cloth and afterconsideration added a third 
 pooh said mrs 
shelf there are five certain and i could tell youtheir names if you didn t know them already 
my husband makes six 
thatcounts twelve votes on a division 
but of course the government isstrong enough to stand it the minister thoughtfully built four salted almonds into an arch andpiled two more at the back of them 
 cave he murmured and then witha tap of the finger sprawled them on the table-cloth 
 there s nothingcertain in this life he said 
 there are caves and caves and some bring down governments 
my husbandand his followers are extreme men and as i have heard you say yourself there is no class of creature so resolute and bigoted as a fanatic 
ifonce an extreme man makes up his mind all the argument on earth will notchange him 
but perhaps you don t mind a dissolution 
perhaps you ve doneso well and passed so many popular measures since you ve been in power that you d like to meet the country at once the minister grinned like a man in pain 
 a knighthood he said is avery fascinating thing 
it is the reward of the faithful 
i think i say ithink i could lay my hands upon one spare knighthood and might give itaway if i saw an adequate return mrs 
shelf smiled amusedly at the diamonds on her comely wrist 
 a knighthood 
that s the thing city men have isn t it when they makemoney by selling patent mousetraps or happen to be lord mayors orsomething like that 
unfortunately my husband would not qualify for aknighthood 
he is not a small pedler 
his what shall i say  operations are more extensive  precisely 
he does things on a fine scale 
for instance he has as isaid at this very moment twelve votes at his command which might makea very considerable difference on a division 
you see conscience is agreat thing with him 
he could never neglect it 
but if he was in theupper house the great minister could comfortably have shuddered 
he was a peerhimself and was jealous for his caste 
but as it was he repressedthis piece of outward emotion and contented himself with saying no quietly softly and with entire decision 
then with a swirlof brilliant talk there was no arresting he deliberately changed theconversation 
mrs 
shelf submitted 
she had another card still to play 
and until she picked up the ladies with her glance and led them awayup-stairs they two spoke of oranges from many points of view 
theyagreed that the large tangerines of majorca were the only oranges fit toeat in england and discussed the various means of getting them imported vi marseilles without suffering them to lose more than a fraction oftheir flavor 
the minister fatuous man thought that she had given in to him andchuckled inwardly at his victory and when the ladies had gone heturned to his next-door neighbor and talked on the ethics of irishcock shooting with a light and easy mind 
but for the next move in thedrawing-room he was frankly unprepared 
he had come to park lane on theclear understanding that a t te- -t te was to be contrived for him withthe ambassador for it is in this way that the great treaties which dallywith the fate of nations receive their birth-push 
i do not say thatthe matter of peace or war depended upon that interview but sufficienthung on it to make the great minister very anxious because he had beendeputed by his colleagues in the cabinet to bring this thing about andhad solemnly undertaken the charge 
and lo 
the chance of this momentous minute s chat was to be withheld 
mrs 
shelf calm clever magnificent came to his elbow the momenthe entered the drawing-room and stayed there 
he was frosty he wasinattentive he was almost rude but he could not shake her off 
she wascool insistent fluent 
she made him sit on a sofa by her side andlaughed almost openly at the attempts he made to shake loose from hisbondage 
at last he broke off in the middle of an aimless sentence and lookedher between the eyes 
she returned the glance most squarely 
there was apause between them and then  by the way baronetcy he murmured 
it was nothing on earth to do with what they had been speaking about theminute previously but the sentence did not require a footnote to explainit further 
 h m she said 
 when  in the next birthday list  thanks 
now you go into the further drawing-room and talk to theambassador and i will clear the people away 
i suppose ten minutes willbe enough  ample said the great minister rising 
then he added by jove 
youare a clever woman 
you re cleverer than your husband  i know i am said mrs 
shelf 
chapter xvii 
in the matter of a trust 
 mr 
fairfax sir to see you  say that i cannot see him the butler hesitated a moment and then begged mr shelf s pardon andhinted that fairfax seemed to have anticipated some such message 
 he said sir i was to explain it was on very important business or hewould not have called so late at night 
and he said too sir here thebutler hesitated again that he must see you  tell him shelf began passionately but there he stopped and therest of the sentence was lost 
fairfax had walked into the room 
the butler stood his ground glancing with nervous respect from one tothe other till shelf waved him to the door through which he vanishednoiselessly with an apologetic sigh of relief 
then the other two facedone another 
 i must say sir the shipowner began with icy politeness that afterwhat has occurred between us this day your intrusion strikes me asvastly wanting in taste 
of course as a christian it has been my dutyto forgive you the injurious thoughts which you bore against me but asa frail human man i confess to have been so wounded by them that thesight of you tempts me to the sin of anger afresh 
but perhaps sir youhave come here to express contrition and to ask that i will hand backthe resignation of the directorate which you so rudely thrust upon me  i have come replied fairfax shortly for neither one thing nor theother 
i am not calling upon you in your city capacity at all 
i wantto speak with you in your position of trustee to the lady whom i am nowshortly going to marry  she has sent you  she is perfectly aware of my errand 
a property in kent has suddenlycome into the market which will go for a comparatively low sum forcash down 
i have been spending the day examining it and meanwhile mysolicitor has been going through the deeds 
the place will suit us to theground and the title is as clear as could be wished for  so you wish to buy this property with your wife s money shelf askedwith a sneer 
 i am not disguising from myself the fact that amy is an heiress 
atthe same time i am not altogether a pauper myself 
but i don t thinkwe two need go into that part of the money question mr 
shelf 
as apoint of fact as you know quite well she and i first met one anotherabroad and fell in love and got engaged without knowing a single wordabout our mutual outlook social or financial 
the point here is that amywants to become part purchaser in this kent property with myself andon her behalf i come to you for the formal permission 
you know by theterms of her father s will she was to have all her wishes with regardto the property taken into consideration after she reached the age oftwenty-one but was still to be under the semi-guidance of the trusteestill she reached her twenty-third birthday  i am only one of the trustees said shelf 
 you must arrange to bringmy co-trustee up to meet me and then i will talk the matter over withhim  i have called on that reverend gentleman before i came to you saidfairfax and he quite meets with mine and amy s views 
he will come upto town and see you himself in the morning at the city office 
but in themean time he sends his permission in this letter fairfax selected a paper from his pocket-book and handed it to mr 
shelf 
 i suppose you recognize the signature he said 
shelf started the paper rustling between his large white fingers 
hehad a sentence on the end of his tongue but with an effort he swallowedit 
then with a frown and a quick catching of the breath he turned tothe letter and read it through 
as it chanced fairfax had seen thatmomentary look of disquiet and being a young man of some penetration he argued down to the reason of it 
 why he asked himself should theold hypocrite be upset when i supposed he recognized his co-trustee shandwriting i m bothered if i can see any definite reason but theremust be something pretty fishy somewhere 
theodore shelf is not the manto let slip that kind of nervousness without some very excellent cause 
i m beginning to think that those of amy s interests which are in hishands will be none the worse for being a little looked after mr theodore shelf glanced up from the letter 
 of course youunderstand he said that i cannot act upon an informal communicationlike this 
my co-trustee is a most excellent christian but i regret tosay a bad man of business  pernicious to say the least of him 
he seems to have the flimsiestnotion of the use of paper and signatures 
still he means entirely well and that is why i do not want to worry him unduly 
so with permission mr 
shelf and to take the burden of details off your shoulders aswell as off his i will instruct my own solicitor to see to all thepreliminaries as to which stock will bear selling out of best  you take it for granted said the shipowner sourly that i shall notput my veto on this scheme for spending my ward s money  why should you 
you have given your consent to the marriage andwhatever may be your personal feelings towards me at any rate you likeher 
she wishes to marry me and intends to do that anyway she wishesfor this estate and i do not see that you have any reasonable groundsfor refusing to gratify her wish besides as an investment the thing isas good as a first mortgage or three per cent 
corporation stock  there are many grave objections to this course said shelf 
 then perhaps said fairfax you will tell me what they are  i do not see that i am called upon to do anything of the kind  there we differ 
moreover mr 
shelf you force me to a very unpleasantconclusion  and what sir might that be  well this said fairfax with a significant stare you ve gotthat money so shall we say securely locked up that it isn t readilyavailable for this new investment  you are talking like a child said mr 
shelf noisily 
 i am talking like a plain business man fairfax retorted who intendsto take reasonable care of his future wife s property 
i think that willexplain my views and as nothing more need be said on that matter iwill leave you 
the other trustee will call upon you at midday to-morrow and i shall make it my duty to accompany him 
so for the present sir  au revoir fairfax left the room and mr theodore shelf lay back in a swivelwriting chair 
mechanically his fingers stretched out and dallied witha book which lay on the table 
it was a bradshaw 
once indeed heopened it and turned up the pages of the express service between londonand southampton and for a full half-hour held it with his finger asa page-marker but at the end of that time he flung the book savagelyacross the room and stood up with clenched fists and the veins standingout of his forehead 
 amy may thank fairfax for saving her property he muttered and athousand people will curse him for doing it 
i believe i m a fool not tobolt now with what i ve got because nothing short of a miracle can bringme up again 
still there s the money subscribed by those poor wretchesfor this new company yet in hand and that will stave off the immediatepresent 
there s just a chance that onslow s coup may be realized onin time and if that comes off i m all right again 
and if it doesn t there s the estan ia on the rio paraguay always ready 
yes george oldchap that it is 
snug and warm beyond worries safe from extradition 
i ll risk it the wire-haired terrier was rubbing against his leg 
he lifted the dog onto the cushion of an easy chair and went to his safe 
he took from thata bundle of papers and spread them on his writing-table 
they were the trust deeds and other papers connected with miss amyrivers property 
some of them were documents distinctly worth lockingup because if the public prosecutor could have run his eye throughthe collection for one short five minutes he would infallibly haveprocured for the saintly mr theodore shelf seven complete years of penalservitude 
it is an unpleasant thing to level such a hint against so good a man but a fact or so will show solid reason for it 
during the two precedingyears partly through depression in trade partly through his wife sbroadcast extravagance theodore shelf had found himself in desperatestraits for money 
he had raised funds this way and that by alllegitimate means had plunged but with evil fortune and finally hadbeen reduced to making his daily income by less reputable means 
for longhe had laid covetous eyes on the fortune of his late partner marmadukerivers which was held in trust for the daughter by himself and a canonof winchester and at last in a moment of desperation he determined tohave the use of it 
the co-trustee was a man who had taken a double-firstat oxford and apparently spent all his life s energies over theprocess 
he had settled down into an amiable country parson who bredprize-bantams and wrote books on armenian folk-lore 
he was extremelyupright vastly unsuspicious and on matters of business possessedan ignorance of unusual profundity 
he respected theodore shelf anddisliked him with an equal intenseness 
when shelf made up his mind to tamper with the rivers property he didnot go through the formality of asking this good gentleman s leave andpermission 
he simply forged himself a power of attorney signed it withthe excellent canon s name and set to work 
being a man who never didanything by halves he did not take two bites at the cherry 
he annexedthe whole of his ward s property lock stock and barrel and paidin the usual interest to her bankers with entire regularity 
humanlyspeaking there was not a chance of his being found out and when fortunesmiled on him again he had every intention of repaying to the uttermostfarthing what he had taken 
as has been said he liked amy riversextremely and if he had not had his worthy self to consider he wouldhave been the last person in the world to do her an injury 
and now this pestilent fellow fairfax must need step in bristling withsuspicion and evidently intending to have money or an inquiry 
ofcourse the latter was a thing which mr 
shelf could not stand for oneminute 
at the first glance it would be shown that the trust property didnot exist in its former state and that the interest had been paid intothe bank out of mr shelf s own pocket 
and so there were only two thingswhich could be done either bolt forthwith or pay the plundered trustout of some other fund and hope that the providence which guards knaveswould pull things straight again 
mr 
shelf had chosen to take the lattercourse and it was the money subscribed by the wretched shareholders ofthe brothers steamship company which was alienated by him to make goodthe property of miss amy rivers 
it required not many strokes of the pen to do this but afterrestitution had been made mr theodore shelf commenced coquetting witha more delicate piece of business 
he desired to hide his tracks 
it washis wish that even if the worst came and he had to fly the country as adetected swindler no one should know that he had tampered with his ownward s trust money 
it seems almost laughable that the man should have put himself to thispiece of pains 
in the vast sweep of his other ponderous frauds thisvery natural one might well pass without special obloquy from the greatshorn public 
but it was not for the general ruck of his victims thatshelf was working then 
he had sacrificed a thousand under compulsion to repay one and having made repayment he wanted to cancel the odiumof robbery 
next to himself and his dog he probably loved amy riversbetter than anything in all the world and if the worst came and he hadto go it would be pleasanter for him to think that she at least wouldhave nothing but kind memories of him 
she would know quite well that hemight have included her fortune in his other robberies because fairfaxwould tell her that if she did not guess it for herself and she wouldfeel a kindness towards him for his forbearance 
of course he would be getting this genial sentiment under falsepretenses but that was a trifle which counted as nothing to mr theodoreshelf 
your true hypocrite deludes no one more perfectly and artisticallythan himself when he sets squarely about it 
the time was long past midnight when he had finished tampering withthe last of the papers on his writing-table and as he passed theblotting-paper over his final forgery he heard the clash of the frontdoor in the hall below 
quickly bunching the papers together he put theminto the safe locked it threw himself into an easy chair and pickedup a quarto volume of his own published sermons 
he was serenely readingthese when his wife sailed majestically into the room with amy rivers ather side 
the girl stepped forward took both of his hands in hers and shook themwarmly 
 all congratulations she said 
 i ve only just heard 
may icall you sir theodore in advance shelf let the book slide to the floor and sat up staring first at oneand then the other 
 i am much obliged to you amy dear he said atlast but upon my word i don t know what you mean  it s out she said 
 everybody was talking about it to-night 
you llbe gazetted in the next birthday list 
and not a trumpery knighthood either 
you re to be a full-blown baronet no less theodore shelf lay back in his chair with a very queer expression onhis face 
he put his white fingers together under his chin and staredcuriously at his wife 
 your doing i suppose laura  you may thank me for it entirely she replied with a smiling bow 
 iarranged for it here with the minister and at the two places where welooked in at afterwards i told the news to three of my dearest friendsin the very strictest of confidence 
consequently it is all over londonto-night and will be in all the papers in england to-morrow 
would youlike to congratulate me  i ll wait said the shipowner till i see you lady shelf 
the title isnot formally given over for a fortnight and between now and then so muchmay happen 
man is but a frail creature  oh for goodness sake said mrs 
shelf disgustedly don t cant now 
when you are sir theodore i can t have you disgracing me by preachingand holding forth to those low people you used to know 
you must cut allthat connection 
good heavens theodore you can t like it 
and there sreally no more to be got out of that sort of thing 
you ve used thosedreary goody-goody folks and made your fortune out of them and letthat suffice 
now if you want to get on further you ve got to pick upwith another set 
don t you understand for reply theodore shelf burst into a sudden wild cackle of laughter 
his wife drew back a step half-scared 
she had scarcely ever heard theman laugh once in all her life with him never like that and she didnot know what to make of it 
but at last he stopped and spoke 
 you rea clever woman laura and a handsome one 
i ve never seen you look sofine as you do to-night 
but you are a bit too rapid in some of yourmovements 
you re counting at present that beyond a doubt the servantswill be calling you miladi within a fortnight and i suppose you llgo out to-morrow and get a new card-plate engraved 
well my dear if iwere you i d wait 
a fortnight is fourteen days and in every minute ofthat time something may happen to bring you an appalling disappointment 
for instance i may die 
take it that the almighty does make me die andwhere then comes in the use for your new card-plate 
there is precedentfor creating a baroness i grant you but i don t think they are likelyto manufacture another precedent by making you lady shelf in your ownright if i am not at hand to share the dignity a servant came in and announced that fairfax was in the hall below 
amy rivers said good-night hurriedly and slipped out of the room 
mrs 
shelf took up her stand in front of the fireplace flushed withtriumph and wrath and looking her superbest 
 you are talking themerest nonsense theodore she said and before that girl too 
thankgoodness she is practically one of the family and will not gossip 
die indeed 
you die 
what an absurdity 
one would think to hear you that the world was coming to an end before the birthday list is out 
ofcourse you will have the baronetcy 
there can t be a doubt about it now thanks to me  what do you want me to say shelf asked 
 well to begin with in common decency you might thank me 
if it had notbeen for my diplomacy in this house to-night you would only have had abeggarly knighthood offered if as much as that 
you have the chance ofmaking a sensation now shelf stood slowly up and strode up to the hearth-rug and faced her with his head thrust forward and his arms folded across his breast 
 yes he said slowly i have a chance of making a sensation one ofthe biggest of the century and mostly owing to your efforts 
the lordgrant that the chance slips away from me 
you are very beautiful and veryclever 
but i believe laura that you are the devil sent expressly onearth to tempt 
you d better go to bed now and leave me 
this is one ofthe times when i am tempted to kill you chapter xviii 
the plume-hunters dinner-party 
the one-eyed man mr billy nutt and his friend and partner whosename was apparently hank without further attachment made a livelihoodby transgressing the laws of the united states and supplying a strongdemand 
ladies of society wished for egret plumes and other feathersfor external adornment and the seminole of the everglades desired cornwhisky for his stomach s sake and whilst game regulations forbadecollection of the first indians protection acts vetoed all distributionof the second 
and for the transgressor there were distinct and heavypenalties 
but to begin with states law does not carry very far in florida which is the home of outlaws and in the second place mr nutt andfriend were both wanted on several counts already amongst whichunjustifiable homicide ranked high so that they were men entirelyreckless and inclined to look upon poaching and illicit whisky peddlingto the aboriginal as the mildest of mild peccadilloes 
moreover as infurtherance of their business they were extremely well armed and apt toshoot first and reflect afterwards when annoyed they were not persons tobe argued with by any of the more gentle methods 
the three men on the steamer were in no way prepared to receive thesedubious visitors were in fact completely oblivious of their approach being still chained in the deadest slumber 
the sun had drooped below thetreetops and already the night noises of the forest were beginning therattle of crickets and toads in the trees the grunting of the bullfrogsin the swamp the dry rustle of the jar-flies and the warm hum of thenever-sleeping mosquito 
in the darker tree aisles there commenced thefireflies brief snappings of light and in the black shadowed water ofthe bayous were other phosphorescent glows like these only coming fromthe eyes of some prowling alligator 
the sloop ran down her jib topsail and as the iron hanks screamedalong the stay a negro trotted nimbly out along the flat bowsprit topto secure the sail in its gaskets 
the wind was dropping with the sun and because the current raced manfully down the bight where the strandedsteamer was lying the sloop made but a fathom or so to the good byevery board across the river 
the one-eyed man danced a barefoot tattooof fury on the floorboards of the cockpit at this slowness and hisloose-limbed partner who still sprawled on the cabin-roof chuckled witheasy amusement 
but the breeze held long enough for their purpose 
theyran up above the steamer and the steam ground their planking againstthe rust-streaked iron 
a pair of davit-falls hung down with the blocksweed-covered in the water and overhauling one of these they made itfast round the bitts 
then swarming up the other fall the whole five ofthem gained the bridge-deck above 
instinctively when once their feet were on the warm gray planks eachman black and white handled his weapon ready to fight or argue asmight be demanded of him but no one appeared to seek explanation oftheir presence and from staring about them they took to staring atone another rather foolishly 
if one has been expecting a brisk game ofmurder and one meets with empty silence it rather spoils the sequenceof ideas 
 come to think of it said hank in an oppressive whisper if there dbeen an anchor watch they d have hailed us before we got this far 
ibet the old man s asleep in the chart-house 
 twouldn t be a bad idea tobottle him he pattered across the deck right hand inside his shirt bosom pistolgripped in that and peered in through the open door 
the place wastenanted by no living thing larger than flies and cockroaches 
he drewback half scared by the eeriness of it and then beckoning his mates headed them down the companion ladder treading like a stage conspirator 
at the foot two doors opened one into the alley-way which was empty the other into the main cabin on the floor of which kettle had beendeposited by the donkeyman 
but in the culminating spasm of his cramp the little captain had rolled away out of sight under the table and soto all appearance this place was deserted also 
the men peered about them and ran aft poking their noses in pantryand galley and engine-room 
coming back through the alley-way theysearched the two mates rooms and found them empty and going outon the iron fore-deck found the forecastle deserted also 
then theygathered round that gaping rent where the fore-hatch had been in curiouswonder examining the crumpled plates which were yellow with new rust and pointing out to one another the twisted stanchions and splintered d bris below 
and at this they were engaged when the sun took its finaldive beneath the waters of the mexican gulf to westward and the tropicaldarkness snapped down upon them like the shutting of a box 
 hank said the one-eyed man this gets me 
what in snakes have theybeen doin to this blame steamboat and for why have they gug-gug-goneoff and left her  euclid s out of my line said hank oracularly 
 oh you blank puttyhead retorted his friend th-th-ink  you tire me 
if they aren t here they aren t 
p r aps they ve gone offand toted the boodle to a cache 
p r aps it s left right here aboard and if it is i guess we shall find it when we want it 
what i m on fornow s grub 
i hain t had a christian meal for three months thanks tothis new sheriff bustling after us and i m about sick of mullet andsweet potatoes 
but please our luck we ll raid their store-rooms hereand fix up a regular hotel supper for to-night 
that s me 
now comealong fellers the negroes chuckled and crowed capering like children and went offwith the tall man towards the galley and nutt after an ineffectualattempt to speak which threw him into a paroxysm of fury presentlyfollowed them 
the feast was sui generis 
they found grease baking powder and flour and made doughnuts they hotted three tins of julienne soup they baked agreat mass of salt pork on a bedding of white beans they made a stew ofpreserved potatoes australian mutton and p t de foie gras and asa chef d uvre one of the negroes turned out some crisp three-cornedtartlets stuffed with strawberry jam 
then hank with a lamp in one hand a cylinder of plates in the other and a whole armory of knives and forksbristling from his pockets pattered off to the main cabin to lay thetable 
at the doorway he stopped gaping and because the instinct of themuch-hunted made his right hand slip round to a certain back pocket theplates went to the ground with a crash 
in the swivel-chair at the headof the table was huddled a man a small man with a cold cigar bittentight between his teeth a man so grimy with coal-dust that hank couldn thave sworn whether the short peaked beard which rested on his chest wasblack or red or prussian-blue 
 oh don t you trouble to be polite said the man in the chair 
 i mmighty glad to see any one who can talk or use a pair of hands here helifted his nose and sniffed the air like a hound 
 is that supper you recooking  i reckon  found anything to wash it down with  there was a dozen bottles of beer but we wanted those between whiles and i guess they re drunk  there should have been more but i suppose my lousy steward has neckedthem 
however this is a big night and this is the first time i veseen you and your mates and so i guess champagne ll be good enough forus 
there s a case in that end room ready a-purpose for this sort ofcelebration day 
perhaps you ll fetch it out i m weak still hank obeyed wonderingly and laid the table and brought on the viands in which he was assisted by nutt and the blacks 
then captain kettle spoke again 
 oh look here friends i m not going to sit at table with niggers 
itake it this isn t a blessed missionary meeting it seemed as though there would be a row 
one of the blacks stated hisintention of taking no sass from that po white trash and anotheropenly drew a razor and made suggestive motions with it through the air 
 of course said kettle if you two gentlemen have chucked your color and care to feed with those ornaments you can do it 
only i m a whiteman and have my pride  that s right said nutt 
 picnicking on the sloop s different 
but thisis a regular hotel supper with napkins and a table-cloth and i guessanything colored ud spoil the tone 
say s-s-s-sonnies you mosey  i done cooked most this yer grub whined he of the razor an i segwine t eat my belly-load  well collar what you want to eat till you bu-s-s-s  yes but whar ll we go nutt looked at captain kettle 
the little man in the swivel-chair gavehis african guests full leave to go to a place considerably hotterthan the engine-hold suggesting the mess-room as an after-thought andalternative whither they betook themselves grumbling 
and then thethree whites commenced their meal 
kettle unwired a champagne bottle with a fork and poured out three longtumblers of dancing froth 
 wine said hank 
 oh my jemima  geg-geg-got any ice queried the one-eyed man 
 ice is off replied the captain 
 things have been that hot this tripit gave up and melted  you seem to got your manners on ice mr billy nutt said his friend 
 now i see an elegant hotel meal in front of me and i m going to makea pig of myself and be jolly well thankful 
i hain t any use for yourhigh-toned sort of canoosering 
see here stuff your silly mouth andquit grumbling right now 
d ye hear me his guests ate and kettle made small talk for them at the same timeplaying a good knife and fork himself 
the food seemed to straighten hisback and knock the limpness out of him but mr nutt and his friend werelapping their champagne too industriously to see any significance in thechange 
they were enjoying themselves with a gusto to which the ordinarygourmand is a stranger 
probably there is nothing on earth so nauseatingas a severe course of the floridan sweet potato 
and consequently thereis no diet so calculated to make one appreciate a more generous menu 
the meal crept steadily through its courses and the empty bottles grewon the cabin floor 
no one got drunk 
captain kettle s own libations weresparing and the others had each a high co-efficient of absorption stillall were exhilarated and ripe for mischief or merriment as might befall 
 say cap said the long man as he dallied with his last strawberrytartlet isn t it so that you ve got this fine steamboat of yoursballasted with sovereigns  it s so said kettle or something very like that  your own  oh lord no 
just freight consigned to new orleans and brought here bythat blow-up i was telling you about 
i suppose that you gentlemen llhave no objection to bearing a hand aboard o me now you are here 
i m abit short-manned and it ud be a pity to let freight like that rust forwant of fingering hank grinned at his vis- -vis and then turned to the little skipper inthe swivel-chair 
 no he said i don t see there s anything wrong withthat 
i m afraid though if we chipped in we couldn t sign on so far asnoo orleans  new orleans be sugared cried captain kettle 
 haven t i spoke plainenough already 
don t you understand all this racket s a blessed swindle 
the steamer s going to have the name-plate on her engines altered andthe label on her stern changed and a different pattern painted on hersmoke-stacks and a coat of gray clapped on her outside 
and then whenshe s so bedevilled her own builder wouldn t know her we ll run herround to some south american port where the least number of questionswill be asked and sell her for what she ll fetch 
but only the steamer mark you 
i reckon she s carried the freight far enough 
that ll bestruck out of her here  you bet said nutt rubbing his hands 
 we ll corral the dollarsfor you right here till you come back 
you shall have our niggers tos-s-stoke for you if you can get em and can manage em 
but they refair toughs 
perhaps you d w-w-weaken when you came to know em a bit  i d handle retorted kettle a crew of old nick s firemen raw out ofhell if i was put to it 
don t you make any error 
i ve kept my end upwith the worst crowds a man ever put to sea with 
by james he went on with a blow at the table by james 
i d handle you mr nutt if youwere signed aboard o me till you couldn t call your soul your own  you d w-w-which snarled nutt rising in his chair 
 sit you swine said his partner and be quiet 
you tire me 
whatare you riling the gentleman for just when we were getting so nice andfriendly with him  you lemme alone  i ll smash your ugly little face in if you don t keep it shut the one-eyed man tried to retort but his infirmity gagged him and aspasm of wild fury bit into all his muscles 
his friend wagged a derisive finger 
 there s an image for you cap 
look at the creature froze like a chinese potdog look at him and don tlaugh 
and say just reach me another bottle of wine it will be sogood 
thanks siree 
i wouldn t care if i died drinking this 
here s ourblessed health 
good old cap you stick to me and i ll stick to you andif mr billy nutt can t swallow his tantrums and join us two gentlemenlike another gentleman by jemima we ll give him what he s got for hisshare and set him adrift in an empty bottle 
you hear me billy nutt  you spup-luttering fool 
you boosey drunken puttyhead  i m not drunk retorted hank but i m merry 
have a sup yourself and then perhaps you ll be better company with which advice a liberalheeltap of champagne splashed in nutt s face 
the man sprang to his feet glowering like a fiend 
what followed wascompleted before a watch could tick twice 
for once the gift of speechdid not desert him 
the fatal words bounced glibly off his tongue andhank s vengeful hands shot out 
in an instant the pair were grapplingtogether and a gouging thumb did its horrid work 
then tearing himselfaway eyeless the lesser man ran screaming blindly into the sideboardat the other side of the cabin 
his friend pitched stiffly forward andfell face downward amongst the dishes lying there without so much as aquiver 
he was stone dead 
with the black-handled knife that had carvedtheir baking of pork nutt had stabbed him from the shoulder down throughhis heart 
 that saves my cartridges said captain kettle and took his cockedrevolver from where it lodged between his knee and the under side of thetable 
he passed swiftly out through the pantry door and was just in time forwhat he expected 
the negroes alarmed by nutt s shrieks were rushingfrom the mess-room to see what had gone wrong 
he charged and drove themfuriously back 
they turned and ran before him tumbling over one anotherin their scared haste and then he took up his place in the doorway threatening them with steady weapon and crisp decisive tongue 
 quick he cried quick you scum unload yourselves 
pitch overboardyour knives and razors and whatever you ve got or by james if a man ofyou stops to think i ll blow his brains through the port-hole the negroes obeyed him in sullen frightened silence and stood withelbows up facing him as he covered them 
kettle watched the three withsteady eye but his ear was cocked down the passage drinking in everyrustle which came from the place he had left 
the shriekings of the eyeless man in the cabin had given way to groans and then there came the sound of bumps and scratchings as though he wereblundering madly about to find something and then the pattering of nakedfeet as he groped his way up the lead-covered steps of the companion 
sointently did they follow this one man s movements that it seemed to themas though all other sounds were hushed even to the never-ceasing hum ofthe insects 
with awe the listeners held their breath for what might come next 
butthey had not long to wait 
from the deck above there burst out a wildtirade of hate and blasphemy which ended in a shrieking cry of despairand a plunging splash and once more the distant noises of the nightclosed in upon them 
 nutt said captain kettle is dead and i m almost sorry 
i believe icould have liked that man 
he d grit in him had nutt and he wouldn ttake cheek from a living soul 
your other boss also is dead killed bynutt 
so you re my niggers now and will be till i ve done with you  whord you mean one of the captives asked with a whine 
 you ll have to do what niggers were sent in the world for and that swork 
your fool of a government says you aren t slaves now and so iwon t treat you as such 
that is you ll be paid 
but i shall get mymoney s worth out of you first  i guess this is a free country 
you can t make us work unless we choose  i ve had that said before to me kettle rejoined grimly by better menthan you white men and they changed their minds when i got to handlingthem 
you ll see later 
but for now you ve got to stay here and if youget out and i find you rambling you ll be shot like crows 
you quiteunderstand he shut the mess-room door and locked it and once more went to the maincabin 
the tall man lay exactly as he had fallen and from underneath hisneck five tricklets of red spread out across the slopped table-cloth like the fingers of a monstrous hand 
the lamplight fell also upon othersmearings of red where nutt had groped his way round the panelling 
kettle leaned up against the rail of the sideboard and wiped his facewith a napkin 
perspiration had loosened the coal dust and the skin cameout white with only here and there a smudge of the old grime 
 supposing he said to himself we were nabbed now and there was atrial who s to prove i didn t put the pork-knife in that man 
oh dearlord what a hat it s getting chapter xix 
subjects for matrimony 
miss kildare gave a shrug to her shoulders 
 yes she said i supposeit is a different me 
i ve got my hair done up and longer skirts andall the rest of it 
in fact like the young person in the book i vegrowed 
but i don t see that you have altered much except that you rejust a tiny-iny bit crows-footy about the eyes 
you haven t even grown amustache as i always wanted you to do  didn t know i was going to meet you or i might have spared my razor  i wish you d known then 
but fancy your turning up here of all places 
it is an extremely small world there s no doubt about that 
well pat aswe ve each said at least twenty times apiece how surprised we are to seeone another suppose you come out on to the piazza and tell me things 
weshall have a crowd round us if we stay here in the hall much longer  my dear child what things asked onslow laughing 
 i ve beenchattering history to you ever since i turned up at the hotel the girl seated herself in a cool cane rocker and picked up a palm-leaffan 
 hundreds of things 
to begin with what are people wearing in townjust now  in london 
oh frock coats rather longer than ever and narrow-stripetrousers and toppers with just twopennyworth of curl in them not more  but i mean the women  fifteen yards to the skirt and they re beginning to drape them 
thefashionable deformity at present is elephantiasis of the biceps i meangigot sleeves 
they start at the ears and go down to the elbows some ofthem further  ah said miss kildare thoughtfully i used to have good arms 
notquite as nice as mabel s though 
but latterly i haven t been in placeswhere evening dress was used 
by the way do you dance still  keen on it as ever  what s the waltz like now  capering on hot bricks 
heaps more exercise to the furlong 
people killthemselves at it much sooner  reverse  in the north of england where they all dance well they re like theamericans and go each way alternately 
in london and the south wheremost of them waltz vilely reversing is aceldama  i suppose said miss kildare with her eyes meditatively followinga bronze-green humming-bird which was darting about a trumpet-vine onthe piazza rail i suppose we shall have a hop here to-night 
i shan treverse and when my partners ask why i shall tell them it s the latestthing 
one always likes to be as english as possible 
tell me somethingelse that it s toney to do  read nasty novels written by women you wouldn t sit in the same roomwith and then gush about them afterwards 
that s a very fashionableamusement with the up-to-date young women  ugh pat don t be a pig 
besides that wouldn t suit my style a bit  but why want to change elsie 
don t you appreciate yourself as you areat present 
i m sure other people would  that s blarney  no said onslow judicially i think it s ordinary fact  is it really though 
i am glad 
you know i ve thought lately mypresent stock-in-trade wouldn t pass muster outside florida 
i can handlea boat in any weather and ride anything that s called a horse and candance decently in american fashion but i can t do anything else exceptperhaps talk if that counts onslow laughed 
 you are refreshing he said 
 but why this inventory ofstock  because pat i m wondering how i shall get on in england 
i m going outthere this fall 
i m two and twenty you know and i can do as i like and living in the back blocks is beginning to pall  going there by yourself  no i m not quite so independent as that 
the van liews the people i mstaying with here spend the winter in london and they re going to takeme with them  and afterwards you come back again to the states miss kildare again watched the bronze-green humming-bird 
 quien sabe she said 
 i may be induced to stay  what 
you re going to get married  why not if i have an invitation 
twenty-two s getting on  ah said onslow and set to rocking his chair 
 yes  i didn t say anything  you said ah patrick and that meant you thought a lot besides  quite right i did 
it had never quite struck me till then that you werea completely grown-up young woman now and might any day see a man togo into permanent partnership with 
it s a bit of a jar i mean it comesoddly to one at first to think of you as married elsie  shoo-ssh pat get up and drive that humming-bird away 
he won t gofor me greedy little beast and if he stays any longer i know he llover-eat himself 
well you d better brace yourself up for a blow because married i mean to be some day 
who knows but what you ll beat mein the race  i  why not 
when duvernay died mabel became a widow  that said onslow is the usual sequence of events  you know she never wanted to marry him  so i was led to understand some five years back 
yet marry him she didnevertheless and that after due publication of banns 
i might remark elsie that that humming-bird you were interested in is still gorginghimself out of those red flowers just on the other side of you  some creatures never know when to stop 
now i do said miss kildare 
 that s the bell for dinner 
i must go and tidy myself meanwhile in that same floridan hotel a certain mr kent-williams ayoung gentleman of england who was throwing poker dice at the bar withtwo friends for ante-prandial cocktails was looking at the same subjectfrom a different coign of view 
he was a young gentleman who had notmade a conspicuous success of himself at home and had been deportedto florida with a view to extracting a fortune from orange growing 
as on reaching the spot he found this was difficult of achievement he wisely did not worry his brain with any vain attempts but wascontent with living in inexpensive retirement under a palmetto-shuckfor nineteen-twentieths of each quarter and blossoming out during theremaining days in riotous living at the point sebastian hotel on theallowance which reached him from home 
and with him were two others whohad been softly nurtured and who were also taking their quarterly nip ofsemi-civilization 
 i tell you said mr kent-williams she s a clinking fine specimen that kildare girl and by jove i ought to be a judge if any one isround here 
look 
three sevens first shot good i ll keep these andsee if i can rattle out another 
she ll go to england and marry a dukeas sure as fits don t you know 
i wonder if onslow will hitch on to theother sister 
looks like it his coming here after the duvernay beastturned up his toes 
i never could stand duvernay not a varsity man don t you know and hadn t been anywhere to school 
simply a bit ofmoney and thought he could swagger on that 
by jove 
two bullets 
thatmakes me a full house and i ll stand on it 
collar the box willie dearboy and beat me if you can  no said willie scooping the dice into the leather box andthoughtfully stirring them before he emptied on to the pewter counter 
 i don t think ar duvernay was anybody 
i did know him here of course because one couldn t help it but i ar don t recollect meeting him at theclub or anywhere before we ar came out 
by ged 
look there 
fours firstshot 
of course the kildares are all right as far as family goes butthey re poor as regards the ar almighty dollar 
if it wasn t for that byged 
i wouldn t mind going in for the fair elsie myself 
wobinson oldchappie take the box and agitate 
you won t beat my four ladies  i wish said kent-williams meditatively i knew what onslow was goingto do 
mabel duvernay s a charming woman and she s got at least a year 
i don t want to make a fool of myself if onslow s still in therunning 
and by jove 
i know she s as fond of him as ever 
that beastduvernay used to twit her with it when he was in an extra vile temper  go slow advised robinson and hang back for bets 
here i can timprove on two pairs so you and i throw again 
here s the box 
by theway why not ask onslow yourself 
you knew him well enough at cambridge and you aren t shy  i m not shy dear boy and i used to know patrick onslow well beforei came out 
he s a devilish genial fellow so long as you rub him theright way but i shouldn t like to cross-question him too much about mrs duvernay 
you see don t you know he was most infernally struck on thelady before she was married and he s one of those fellows with a longmemory who don t forget 
now i dear boy have been in love with heapsof women in my time and they with me but when they gave me the chuck or i got tired of them i didn t break my blessed heart or play thegoat or do anything of that kind 
i simply went on to the next caravan which is a devilish comfortable amusement 
but old pat isn t built thatway 
he s one of those fools who would get gone on a woman and keep herin mind for years and years afterwards 
mighty dreary sort of game to myway of thinking 
by jove 
four kings 
if you beat those dear boy may ilive on sweet potatoes and mullet for all the rest of my natural life  oh lord said robinson a year twenty-five hundred dollars 
one could pig along with that very comfortably in lots of places 
whatunlucky brutes some of us are 
oh curse it just my form two pairsagain 
we won t prolong the agony 
my shout what ll you fellows have they drank their cocktails and went into the vast bare dining-hall where a shining negro waiter supplied each with a tumbler of iced tea andtwo dozen oval dishes of comestibles 
 onslow seems thick enough with the kildare girl kent-williamsobserved 
 but of course he knew her when she was a kid and they dhave heaps to talk about 
what do you think willie  how should i know dear chappie 
i m not one of those thought-readingfellows 
but perhaps she s ar telling him about her sister 
girlsalways try and run a fellow for their sisters if they can t get thefellow ar for themselves  here waiter shouted robinson what did you bring sweet potatoes for 
nobody ordered them 
take the damned things away and bury them thewaiter grinned and vanished with the dishes and robinson set to savagelytearing at a tough beefsteak with a silver-bladed knife 
 money s runout he grumbled and back we go to-morrow to live like wild beasts ina palmetto-shuck on that accursed food and nothing else 
i believe thatfoul grinning nigger knew and brought those sweet spuds here just toinsult us 
i ve a great mind to break his beastly neck  what s the use of getting hot over it this weather said kent-williams 
 if you did break the nigger s neck it wouldn t add to your income andthat s the only occupation i know worth living for  and therefore you want to marry mrs duvernay  or any one else with a modicum of dollars 
i m not prejudiced 
believeme dear boy i could pour out a whole wealth of affection on sweetmabel or sweet kitty or sweet anybody else who was able to supportme in moderate comfort 
at present my talents are thrown away duringnineteen-twentieths of the year because nature never intended me toshine as a noble savage 
consequently dear boy i m ready to throwmyself away on any one  oh i like that said robinson 
 you might have married a girl herelast winter  the traveling english person without the aitches 
yes dear boy i didthink about it 
but i came to the conclusion that she was too old toreform and don t you know one really couldn t stand living with anaitchless person eternally for any amount of income 
of course it was asacrifice and the poor girl was very let down but i think she ll getover it in time 
they all do  probably she has done said robinson grimly 
 from what he said herfather was quite resigned to your loss before he left here  my prospective father-in-law was sordid 
he couldn t appreciate agentleman 
now mabel s papa is in a better land and by jove 
that s agreat point in her favor 
i never could stand paternal advice  you seem to be making pretty sure of getting the lady  i m not at all sure but i want to find out how the land lies 
and by jove 
clever thought 
i know how to do it 
i ll go to onslow afterdinner tell him i m going to call on mrs duvernay to-morrow and offerto take him down there in my dug-out 
i shall soon see what his game is 
if he s after her still he ll look jealous and trust me for seeing it and if he isn t why it s a walk-over  all the same remarked his other friend i don t think i d ar put verylong odds on you old chappie 
there s nothing certain in this life andwidows are apt ar to keep a fellow dangling till a fellow gets tired 
finished 
then let s go to the bar and throw for liqueurs

at point sebastian 
now the great rambling wooden hotel in which miss elsie kildare wasstaying under care of her friends the van liews though on the endof a telegraph-wire and within easy day s steam of a railroad wasnot particularly far in crow s-flight from that uncharted river wherethe port edes lay stranded on a sand-bar 
the hotel in fact backedupon the everglades and faced the blue crisping waters of the mexicangulf 
at one side of it was a plantation of sisal hemp and beyond thatthickets of saw-grass and beyond again cypress-trees and cabbage-palmssprouting from an undergrowth which was bound into an impenetrable cheveux de frise with wait-a-bit thorn 
at the other side were newlyplanted umbrella-trees two decrepit orange-bushes without fruit twentyluxuriant chumps of elephants ears and then straggles of palmetto-scrubright down to the soft white banks of gulf sand 
beyond was clear bluewater with a rickety wooden wharf straddling a mile out into it likesome uncouth gray-legged centipede 
and beneath the water dented rustyfood-cans grew intimate with the coral polyp 
in winter time point sebastian was a resting-place for nabobs of thenorth and a congregation spot for those delightful american women wholeave a convenient husband at work elsewhere on the dollar-mill 
but in the warmer months these worthy people did their pleasure-living atthe sea beaches of the north or the hotels of the alleghanies and therest-house at point sebastian locked and covered most of its glories 
thefloridan who stays in florida all summer does so usually because of atightness in the exchequer and for the few of him who came to dissipatea small but hardly scraped-up hoard in a spell of semi-civilization atenth of the available rooms made ample lodging place 
still there was a summer season of sorts at point sebastian whichwas merry enough in its way 
most nights on the parquet of the hall a cheery score danced under the glare of electric lights to the liltof teuton fiddles and in the cool gloom of the piazzas outside ifstraitened means did prevent the actual drafting of marriage contracts even penury undisguised could enjoy the dallyings of the week sflirtation 
mr kent-williams and his tribe were entertaining fellowsenough to meet for a limited time and maidens come into the hotel foran annual outing basked in the odor of their pretty sayings and franklyprepared themselves for nothing beyond temporary amusement 
patrick onslow met at least five men there he knew which shows thegreat advantage of being a university man because since at oxfordand cambridge they most successfully refrain from teaching anythingthat is of commercial use to any one except a parson or a doctor or aschool-master it naturally follows that many men from those seats oflearning fail to make a living at home and drift across the seas 
he did not make the smallest secret about his advent 
as the newspapershad told them already he had been on the unlucky port edes when shecame to grief but had managed to get ashore by a marvelous streak ofluck and found himself at a spot where less than a year ago he hadbeen wandering about on a shooting expedition 
thence he had made his wayin a dug-out bought from a seminole to the hotel on point sebastian 
 v la tout 
there was nothing surprising about it 
he had had severalopportunities for drowning before that but none of them had ever comeoff 
so he supposed that the parc marked him out to live 
and whatwould they have 
his shout 
at that period mr patrick onslow was feeling extremely pleased withhimself 
he hated the work at which he had been engaged as any man musthate being mixed with a swindle be it great or small 
and the end seemednear the end conjoined to full success 
he had had a struggle for it because once more captain kettle had feltinclined to fight for his own hand rather than do all things for mereemployers who only paid him a small salary 
it was when onslow woke fromthat dead sleep on the wheel grating of the upper bridge and came downto learn of the tragedy of the plume-hunters which had taken place duringhis unconsciousness that he got the first hint of this 
the littlecaptain received him with cold stiffness was wooden when asked for anysuggestion and snarled when onslow inquired what ailed him 
it was thedonkeyman who put the difficulty into words 
 and captain now said he how much might yez be getting out of allthis for yerself   begor it s a mighty lot of money and little enough too 
i wish i d itmeself an more 
i d like a house ashore an a wife an an ass-cartthat i might dhrive her out in like a gentleman besides other things  oh stop that 
don t tell me what a man might do if he d his pickof the money in this ship 
i can figure that out for myself withoutsuggestions from any blasted irishman 
have been doing in fact  ah now captain dear don t be cross wid me because i was going on tosay that in case of trouble in case there was we ll say a thriflingargument i d be on your side 
mr onslow you re a gentleman an i likeye well but the captain here s me officer an well sor a boy must lookafter himself sometimes specially when there s a chance like this readyto his fingers 
 twon t come again in a lifetime  probably not said onslow 
he lay back in his chair with linked fingersbehind his head 
 look here kettle if you want to shoot me pull outyour gun and get it over 
then you and sullivan can run the cargo whereyou please and share it how you like 
but that s the only way you llmake me consent to your taking what s beyond your due 
shelf trusted me and by jove i m going to act fairly by shelf if he were a ten timesbigger thief than i know him to be already 
now then jump quick let shave it over they were in the chart-house 
captain kettle puckered his head for aminute s thought and then getting up shut and locked the starboarddoor 
he took that key and the key also of the other door which gaveupon the head of the companion-way and handed them both to onslow 
 now sir said he you lock me and the donkeyman in here and go anddo as you like 
but i advise you to take your infernal gold somewhere outof this ship because as sure as it s there when i next come out of thisroom so sure do i go and loot it 
that s my bunk there bang above theplace where it s stowed and i ve sat on top of those sovereigns like ahen every watch below i ve had this voyage and heard em chinkle andwondered what they d hatch out into 
you perhaps understand what i mean onslow nodded 
 then take the synch from me sir and cart your boxes away as quickas you can 
poor men like me shouldn t have big temptations 
it isn thealthy for their neighbors 
no by james 
here get out of this mr onslow or i shall be doing you a violence yet and mind you lock thedoor 
donkey-man you hound there s whisky in that bottom locker 
takethe clean glass yourself and give me the dirty one onslow read the little man s mind to a comma and bowed gravely withoutspeaking 
then he did as he was bidden with the door and key and wentbelow and began the herculean task of bringing up the iron-bound specieboxes one by one out of the cabin where they had ridden from the merseydock 
he placed them in the port quarter boat which he had lowered fromits davits flush with the bridge deck rail and when she was loaded heput the boat into the river 
he rowed her far up stream past bights andbayous till he found a narrow canal leading off the main river throughmangrove clumps and held on up that till the boat reached a great roundvat of black water walled all around with solemn cypress-trees androofed to darkness by their fringing branches 
one by one the boxes were raised on the gunwale and launched with asullen plunge and it seemed an age before the foul-smelling bubbles cameup to tell that they had sounded bottom 
and then away back for anotherload 
and then for a third 
the inky water closed over all and not somuch as a splinter from one of the boxes floated on the surface 
small fear of any one raiding that cache onslow thought and two dayslater with a clear mind he was cabling right to theodore shelf fromthe eastern union telegraph company s office in the hotel hall at pointsebastian 
 now modern science enables us to cry a message by wire round halfthe earth at breakfast time and have an answer returned to us beforethe gong sounds for luncheon and it was in anticipation of a quickexchange of news like this that onslow had come to the nearest outpost ofcivilization 
he had hidden his of gold released the two men in thechart-house with instructions that when they felt inclined orsufficiently recovered for work they should with the negroes help setabout transforming the steamer s appearance and afterwards had made hisway partly overland by an indian s path he knew of partly in dug-outthrough lagoon and bayou to point sebastian 
it was an entire surpriseto him to meet miss kildare there 
but this time it was no special shock 
that early morning glimpse of her in the schooner had warned him of herneighborhood 
he got a return message to his cable it is true but not before noon onthe following day 
it said take no steps am writing and seemed tohint at a change of plan 
in another place he might have resented the delay 
at least eleven daysmust pass and probably more before a letter could reach him and allthe while he would be condemned to inaction and anxiety 
but as it was he read mr theodore shelf s reply cablegram with a frown which wasquite evanescent and felt a mild satisfaction in the respite 
in theafternoon he took out miss kildare to fish for tarpon 
by one of those singular chances which occur every century or so atarpon they did actually catch on that first day of fishing a thirtypound monster with glittering silver scales on him as big as dollars who gave three hours frantic fight before he turned his belly to theskies and submitted to traveling beachwards in the boat 
 we got him between us said miss kildare 
 that s my first and i vetried for him times out of number  my first also and i ve tarpon-fished for weeks  we seem to bring one another luck  it s an undoubted fact elsie we do the deduction seemed to give rise to thoughts in each of them and theylet their eyes rove vaguely over the blue gulf waters for the next fewminutes without speaking whilst the boat rode gently over the windlessswells which slid in through the outlying keys 
a porpoise surged pastthem coughing as he chased a shoal of mullet and overhead a stringof purple and yellow cranes screamed wearily as they flapped home to theeverglades after a day s hard fishing on a growing reef 
 they ve all got to make their living said onslow 
 who asked the girl 
 i was thinking of those animals in the water and in the air and byanalogy the rest of the animal world 
we all of us prey on somethingelse down to the ass who eats grass or else we die  that s a very sage remark pat 
have you been reading schopenhauerlately or is your bank account unhealthy onslow laughed 
 was it pessimistic 
i m not given that way as a generalthing 
it s so much pleasanter for one s self and everybody else tolook at matters from the cheerful point of view 
but i was thinking atthe time that if i d been well off and if other things had not happenedas they did my life would have been written very differently  you mean you might have been her majesty s ambassador to the court oftimbuctoo  or something in that line possibly yes  mabel said the girl is free now onslow nodded dreamily and once more let his gaze roam out across thewaters 
the boat rode uncared for over the gentle oily swells and thesound of the surf crumbling on the distant keys fell on his ears anddroned to him a lingering tale of might-have-been 
mabel was free 
thewoman who had once promised to be his wife the woman whose memory haddriven him from pillar to post across the world through all those long wild years because his abiding love for her was too great a torment tobe borne when he rested for a breathing space in one spot and had timefor thought 
the woman who had by pressure been made to marry anotherman whom neither on her wedding day nor at any after time did she everlove was free again 
mabel duvernay now and mabel kildare no longer but mabel still and free 
chapter xxi 
the cyclone 
a shining-faced negro waiter came up in answer to the bell and broughttumblers of tinkling ice and water 
both onslow and miss kildare drankthirstily and then lay back again in their cane chairs panting 
theclose heat was something terrible 
there was not a breath of either seabreeze or land breeze and the electric fan which whirred on the tablebehind them did little more than send a blast of sickly warmth 
down thelong line of the piazza were the rest of the people in the hotel themen cursing and mopping their faces the women with closed eyes fanningthemselves languidly 
and overhead the shingles of the roof crackledand rustled in the baking air as though they were alive 
night came and the bell clashed out its summons to dinner but no onewent in 
the wooden sides of the hotel baked through and through by amonth of tropical sun had made the rooms unendurable 
so they stayedwhere they were in the hot oppressive dark and blinked at the whitesummer lightning which splashed the violet heavens in front of them 
inheavy panting beats the night seemed to close down upon them and pen themin so that it was a labor to breathe 
 i can t stand this said miss kildare at last 
 you ve got to replied onslow wearily unless you choose to go downthe beach and sit in the water with your clothes on  that would be some relief although the water is as hot as tea 
but ishan t do that 
i shall walk out along the pier over the sea 
one mayfaint half way and tumble over and get drowned but anyway that s betterthan staying here and being cooked slowly they got up together and strolled wearily over the loose white sand and then more crisply over the worn decking of the pier 
between thelightning flashes the darkness above them was the darkness of a cave but faint phosphorescent fringes showed out amongst the piles beneath and these guided them from walking over the edge of the planks 
 you shouldn t stay down here this weather onslow said as they paceddown the narrow platform with fingers intertwined 
 you ll lose yourcolor and your beauty if you do and get thin and sallow like mrs vanliew no reply came and onslow said nothing more but walked on thinking 
 you ve been here now nine whole days pat the girl said breakingsilence for the second time when they were half a mile from the shore 
 it can t be 
yes you re right 
nine days 
time has gone quickly 
whathave we been doing all the time 
fishing once or twice and a picnic tothat mound-builder s place down the canal and i believe that s all 
we ve just talked and sometimes not even talked 
you and i little girl know one another well enough to be companionable without always chatting 
you see we ve always known one another 
but still nine solid days 
i dno idea till you spoke how long it was in actual point of time 
it s beenvery restful  you seem to have found it so 
you ve stayed all the time close abouthere 
do you know you have not once gone so much as a dozen miles frompoint sebastian mrs duvernay s place was fifteen miles away 
onslow saw the point 
 no he said 
 i haven t found time 
you and i have had so much to tellone another elsie  we always have been very good friends said the girl and was goingto add something else when her words were drowned by a furious crash ofthunder 
there had been no working up to it
